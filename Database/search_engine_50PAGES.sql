Ancelotti\'s successful playing career in Italy has been followed by an even more impressive managerial one, taking up his first role at Reggiana before going on to some of the world\'s best clubs, including Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Everton\'s Dogs of War relived: 25 years on Can Carlo Ancelotti end Everton\'s 25-year trophy wait? Gylfi Sigurdsson targets strong Everton finish He also had a two-year spell with Chelsea between 2009 and 2011, and returned to the Premier League earlier this season to take over at Everton. Speaking exclusively to Sky Sports pundit Carragher for The Football Show, Ancelotti reveals all about his coaching career so far plus an insight on how he managed some of the famous players he has worked with... Finding space for Zola at Parma Gianfranco Zola was moved from his favourite position by Carlo Ancelotti at Parma \"Parma was the first top professional team that I managed and I had [Gianfranco] Zola in that period. At the beginning, I was playing 4-4-2, I was not playing with a No10 in that period so in the first game of the seaso I tried to put him [Zola] on the right side like a winger. He didn\'t like it a lot, he did well in my opinion, but he would like to play in the middle. So having [Hernan] Crespo and [Enrico] Chiesa in front, I found space for him on the right side, but he was not so happy. \"At the same time, he had an opportunity to go to Chelsea and in the January market, he chose to go there and I let him to go.\" \'Zidane changed my idea about football\' Zinedine Zidane had a profound impact on Carlo Ancelotti\'s footballing philosophy at Juventus \"With Zidane, I tried to change my idea about the system. Zidane is the first player who gave me the possibility to change the system and play in a different way. So when I had Zidane, in the first year at Juventus, I played with a system of 3-4-1-2, having [Alessandro] Del Piero and [Filippo] Inzaghi up front and Zidane a little bit behind. The second year, I played with a back four but keeping two strikers in front and one No10 like Zidane. \"Zidane changed my idea about football, I was so focused before Juventus on 4-4-2 and after with Zidane, I changed, I wanted to put him in the best position for him to let him be more comfortable on the pitch. Teams managed by Carlo Ancelotti Reggiana (1995-1996) Parma (1996-1998) Juventus (1999-2001) AC Milan (2001-2009) Chelsea (2009-2011) PSG (2011-2013) Real Madrid (2013-2015) Bayern Munich (2016-2017) Napoli (2018-2019) Everton (2019-present) \"In my playing career, I had [Nils] Liedholm [at Roma] who was one of the first managers who played the zone, but it was not 4-4-2, it was back four but in midfield, we didn\'t have a specific position. Then after that, I had [Sven-Goran] Eriksson in Rome and he played 4-4-2 and [Arrigo] Sacchi in Milan, so I started training and having the idea to play 4-4-2. \"And this idea changed after Parma when I had Zidane, I wanted to have him in a comfortable position for him. \"The experience at Juventus was good in my opinion because I understood really well how the club has to work for the manager so the club gave to me a lot of support in this. It doesn\'t matter if they fired me at the end of the second year, until the last day in Juventus, I understood how the club has to work for the manager, to support them, to help them in front of the players, to give the manager the power that he needs to manage the players.\" \'Milan felt like home\' Carlo Ancelotti won his first major trophy with AC Milan in 2003, lifting the Champions League \"First of all, I think the fact that I was in Milan as a manager having played there, I knew the structure of the club, I knew some of the players there because some of the players I managed at Milan were my team-mates, like [Paolo] Maldini, [Demetrio] Albertini, [Alessandro] Costacurta so this helped me at the beginning to help build a good period in Milan. \"I was really comfortable in Milan because the support that I had was really strong support. I felt in Milan like I was at home, like a family. Trophies won as a manager Juventus (1) - UEFA Intertoto Cup AC Milan (8) - Serie A, Coppa Italia, Supercoppa Italiana, Champions League (2), UEFA Super Cup (2), Club World Cup Chelsea (3) - Premier League, FA Cup, Community Shield PSG (1) - Ligue 1 Real Madrid (4) - Copa del Rey, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, Club World Cup Bayern Munich (3) - Bundesliga, DFL-Supercup (2) \"The final match against Juventus [in the Champions League], it was a good rematch for me, but it was not revenge. I think it was really important for me that victory because the Champions League in 2003 was my first trophy and for this reason, it was really important. \"I think it was the right decision from both sides [when deciding to leave for Chelsea]. It was not so difficult because after eight years, I needed to change and at the same time, maybe the club needed to change so we decided to together. It was the right time to decide, I wanted to have a new experience outside of Italy so I had the opportunity to go to Chelsea. But it was a good decision, it was not difficult to choose.\" \'Chelsea were a really fantastic team\' 2:00 Carlo Ancelotti reflects on his time at Chelsea, including the contributions of players such as Frank Lampard, John Terry and Didier Drogba Carlo Ancelotti reflects on his time at Chelsea, including the contributions of players such as Frank Lampard, John Terry and Didier Drogba \"The second year was more difficult, but the first year was really fantastic. The club had the goal for the Champions League, but the fact that in the first year we won the Premier League and the FA Cup was really important and really exciting. Chelsea\'s 2012 CL triumph: Lampard\'s memories Tomori lifts lid on Lampard\'s Chelsea \"The second year was more difficult, I think, because we had some problems. We had [Didier] Drogba with malaria and these kinds of problems. We started really well and we finished really well but the middle of the season was not so good. \"Drogba was fantastic. In the first year, he scored 36 goals but to mention Drogba means to forget [Nicolas] Anelka, for example, [Florent] Malouda, Joe Cole, [Salomon] Kalou, Michael Ballack in the middle, [Michael] Essien, Deco and at the back, Alex, [Branislav] Ivanovic, Ashley Cole so the team really, really was a fantastic team. The Italian won the Premier League in his first season at Chelsea \"When I arrived, the team was there, I didn\'t build the team, so I was really excited to train these kinds of players with this kind of power. Imagine when you needed to prepare set pieces, you had John Terry, Alex, Drogba, Ballack to jump so it was not so difficult to score on set pieces. \"I\'m not surprised [to see Lampard as a manager] because as a player, Frank had fantastic tactical qualities. I\'m waiting now for Terry as a manager, now he\'s an assistant, but I think they both have the qualities to be a good manager. Of course, Frank is doing really well at Chelsea now.\" Comparing Italy and England Carlo Ancelotti says he prefers the Premier League atmosphere to that in Italy \"It is more enjoyable [managing in the Premier League], definitely. There is less pressure here from the supporters and the atmosphere is better in England. \"I came back to Italy after nine years and it didn\'t change a lot, the pressure is the same and with the supporters, there is a lot of violence. Italian football is trying to change but it is not easy to change the culture of a country where unfortunately there is still violence and assault. \"Here in England, the people in the stadium, and I\'m talking about only in the stadium, are more respectful.\" \'As a manager, you have to try Real Madrid for one day\' The manager won the Champions League in his first season at Real Madrid \"I think when you are a manager, you have to try and manage Real Madrid one day in your life. I spent two years there and it was an unforgettable experience because I think Real Madrid is the best club in the world for the image that they have outside. \"Everywhere we went, in every country, there were a lot of people there who wanted to see you, to support the team so it is an unforgettable experience, a top organisation, a fantastic training ground and a fantastic team at the time when I arrived. Are Real Madrid targeting another rebuild? La Liga Q&A: How Spanish football plans to return \"The team had some problems in the past years when I arrived there. The fact that they were not able to win the Champions League for 12 years was like an obsession for them because Real Madrid was used to winning a lot of Champions Leagues. I had the luck in the first year to win it [in the 2013/14 season]. \"You don\'t have to build a team around Cristiano Ronaldo and as I said with Zidane, you have to put them in the more comfortable way on the pitch. I don\'t think you have to build strict tactics with this player defensively because there are players who are more involved in the attacking phase and there are players who have to be involved more in the defensive phase. Carlo Ancelotti also reflected on his time coaching Cristiano Ronaldo \"Of course, they have to work together because the team is the most important part of the game, but strikers like Ronaldo who are able to score every single game, you don\'t have to give too much information defensively. \"It is the easiest way to be a manager, to manage a fantastic player because they are professional, they are serious, they have personality, they are motivated so it is the easiest way. \"Sergio Ramos also has a fantastic quality. I think his best quality he has is not tactically, it\'s not technically, it\'s character and the personality that he has and the ability he has to motivate the people around him, like his team-mates. Ramos during that period was important for this, he was always at the top when the game was important and in the key moment of the games.\" Returning to the Premier League with Everton 2:39 Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti says the club have ‘good goals’ for the future and discussed why he returned to the Premier League Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti says the club have ‘good goals’ for the future and discussed why he returned to the Premier League \"First of all I wanted to come back to Italy [after leaving Bayern]. I had an experience at Napoli and it was a good experience there but if I had to choose a league, I wanted to come back to the Premier League for the atmosphere you feel here and the atmosphere the Premier League has. \"The fact I had the opportunity to come to Everton was really important. Everton is a club with a fantastic history, fantastic tradition and they have a goal to be at the top. We are trying to, if we are able after the COVID [shutdown], we will try to do our best.

Through my staff, we are in contact with them, they are working a lot at home but of course, everyone else would like to start soon. This is not the comfortable behaviour with how we would like to work or spend time together. The way I like more is to stay with my players and train with them, work with them, talk with them and I hope that soon, we will be able to do this. \"I think everyone in the club is working to try to be at the top soon. Of course, there is a lot of competition here in the Premier League but I think we have a possibility. We have a good goal, we are building a new stadium so we know that behind us is fantastic supporters and fans that help us to be motivated. I think soon, we can be competitive.\" Super 6: Dortmund to keep heat on Bayern? Super 6 is back. Do not miss your chance to land the £50,000 jackpot. Play for free, entries by 2:30pm.

A silver anniversary of no silverware. May 20, 1995 - a 1-0 win over Manchester United in the FA Cup final. Everton\'s Dogs of War relived: 25 years on Coleman leading the way as Everton captain Digne: Everton can reach CL with Ancelotti John Major was Prime Minister, Robson and Jerome topped the charts, Richarlison wasn\'t even born. 9,132 days later, Evertonians are still waiting for another day like that. A fanbase starved of success, but it wasn\'t always that way. Growing up as a Blue in the \'80s, I assumed we\'d always be playing in finals and winning titles. I jumped on the bandwagon as a six-year-old in 1985, the club\'s finest hour as we won the League and European Cup Winners\' Cup. Only a Norman Whiteside goal in extra-time in the FA Cup final denied us a treble. 21:45 Everton\'s famous 1995 FA Cup win over Manchester United, revisited on its 25th anniversary by two men who made it possible, Paul Rideout and Graham Stuart. Everton\'s famous 1995 FA Cup win over Manchester United, revisited on its 25th anniversary by two men who made it possible, Paul Rideout and Graham Stuart. A year later we were back at Wembley, beaten this time by Liverpool, my first taste of heart-breaking defeat to our biggest rivals. Yes, there have been one or two more since! Twelve months later, my dad took me to Goodison Park for the first time and we were champions again. You could call me a glory hunter. There\'s not been much glory since. \"It\'s very hard to accept as an ex-player and as a supporter that we haven\'t been close enough and won anything in 25 years,\" former striker Graham Stuart told Sky Sports. He\'s now a club ambassador but played in the 1995 final and might\'ve scored the winner too, had he not hit the bar from close-range. Thankfully, Paul Rideout was in the right place at the right time to head in the only goal of the game. \"There\'s not many of us that can do that, play a one-two off the bar for your strike partner! Paul set me up in the semi-final so it was only right I set him up in the final. Match-winner Paul Rideout celebrates his strike in the first half at Wembley \"I was only eight yards out, and in some respects I connected too well, they\'re the ones that if you scuff it they dribble into the bottom corner. It hit the underside of the bar but thankfully Paul saved my blushes. But at the time I didn\'t care, you\'ve won an FA Cup final and that\'s all that matters.\" Now based in the USA, Rideout\'s dined out on that goal ever since, even if most of the kids he coaches in Arizona have no knowledge of what he achieved before they were born. \"Sometimes they come in with their phones and their parents have looked me up, and they come and show me it and you talk to them about it. Matchday hero Rideout with Neville Southall after victory in 1995 at Wembley \"I have lived off it for 25 years and that\'s all thanks to Graham, he set it up. The sad part is my celebration afterwards, not knowing what to do, it was a sad celebration! But when you score at Wembley it\'s a special place.\" For the record, Rideout\'s celebration consisted of running away to the Everton fans with two hands in the air before blowing a kiss. True, there was no Duncan Ferguson shirt-waving or Tim Cahill-esque corner flag boxing, but I\'ve seen worse! Everton have been back to Wembley for just one Cup final since, in 2009. Louis Saha scored after just 25 seconds, the fastest goal in an FA Cup final. I remember turning to my mate once the celebrations had calmed down and saying \"we\'ve scored too early\". Louis Saha gave Everton the perfect start with the fastest FA Cup final goal A pessimism and \'it\'s bound to go wrong\' attitude has developed over the years. Sadly, I was right. We lost 2-1. Leon Osman felt the pain more than most in the team that day, having been at the club since he was a lad. At the age of 14, he\'d signed schoolboy terms in Joe Royle\'s office days before the 1995 final. \"I\'ve not been able to look back on it and watch, it was just such a disappointing day in my career with the hype around it and you know what could be possible at the end of it\". It\'s that possibility, that opportunity for overnight hero status with the fans that awaits every Everton team at the start of each new season - can they be the ones to bring silverware back to Goodison? Of course, qualifying for the Champions League - as they did under David Moyes in 2005 - would be a giant step forward and re-establish the club on the European football map but you can\'t put fourth place in the trophy cabinet. So why have trophies eluded the club in an era when Leicester have won the Premier League with a squad assembled for just over £50m and Wigan, Swansea and Portsmouth have all won cups at Wembley? Everton manager David Moyes looks dejected after the 2009 FA Cup final \"If it was as simple as one reason I\'m pretty sure it would\'ve been figured and changed,\" Osman told Sky Sports. \"In the past, the club struggled for a bit of money, they were fighting for relegation for years rather than at the top of the table. And with all that came a lack of belief. We were getting to cup finals and semi-finals and we just lacked that real belief to get that first trophy won. \"To be an Evertonian and have Liverpool winning trophies is hard to take, knowing I was one of the people who could do something about it and for whatever reason was unable to do so. You feel the burden, you feel the disappointment and I hope as soon as possible this next generation of players can bring a trophy to Goodison Park.\" Defeat in the FA Cup semi-final to Liverpool in 2012 was especially painful Everton do have money now, thanks to the financial muscle of their billionaire major shareholder Farhad Moshiri. He has spent around £450m on players since his arrival in 2016 and yet in the three completed seasons since, Everton finished no higher than eighth in the Premier League and won just four cup ties, progressing no further than the fourth round. So, is it really all about the money? \"It\'s luck at times,\" Osman added. \"The season before 2009 Portsmouth had got to the final against Cardiff, but when we got to the semi-finals it was Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal. We got to the semis in 2012 and it was top four sides again. We just kept finding ourselves having that good run when the top sides were desperate to win trophies themselves that season.\" Manchester United scored a last-minute winner in 2016\'s FA Cup semi-final But as Evertonians know only too well, we\'ve been our own worst enemy at times too. You only have to go back to January to see that, when Jurgen Klopp put out the Liverpool kids in the FA Cup third round, but we still lost. The wait for a win at Anfield - another millstone around our neck - goes on. Twenty years and counting. That defeat was just a few weeks into the reign of the latest manager brought in to try and bring the good times back to Goodison Park. With the club 16th in the table at the time, Carlo Ancelotti\'s appointment was seen as a major coup. The dapper Italian is a silver-haired silverware specialist who\'s won trophies in five different countries (including England with Chelsea) and three Champions League titles - but is he the man to reignite Everton\'s fortunes? Two of the class of \'95 certainly think so. The Gwladys Street faithful have instantly warmed to their new manager \"We couldn\'t have anybody better than Carlo,\" Stuart told Sky Sports. \"He knows how to put a good side together, he won\'t suffer fools, he commands respect but we\'ve got to give him a bit of time.\" Rideout agrees. \"He reminds me a bit of Joe Royle in the way he\'s calm. I think he\'ll be great for the younger players. He\'s done it on and off the field at great big clubs, his reputation is superb so he\'s got the respect of the players straight away.

Everton is a huge club, it\'s a giant of a club, it doesn\'t matter how good or bad, the consistency of the fans is the same. I think it will go on to great things\". Like all Evertonians, I really hope he\'s right. Super 6: Dortmund to keep heat on Bayern? Super 6 is back. Do not miss your chance to land the £50,000 jackpot. Play for free, entries by 2:30pm.

David Moyes\' team of 2009 came close to ending the hoodoo but they were beaten in the FA Cup final at Wembley by Chelsea. There have been other near-misses, painful semi-final defeats to Manchester United and Liverpool in the same competition along the way. Can Carlo end Everton\'s 25-year trophy wait? Everton refund fans for remaining games Digne: Everton can reach CL with Ancelotti A quarter of a century on from the club\'s last success, Joe Royle, Graham Stuart and Paul Rideout reminisce about a memorable day down Wembley Way, where thanks to the Dogs of War mentality, Everton beat United to lift the FA Cup for the fifth time in their history... The context An aerial view of Wembley\'s famous twin towers ahead of the 1995 FA Cup final Joe Royle replaced Mike Walker as Everton manager in November 1994, with the side stranded at the bottom of the Premier League with just eight points from 14 games. He guided the club to a Merseyside derby victory in his first game in charge, a 2-0 win at Goodison Park… Joe Royle: \"If you look at our form from our first game against Liverpool in the November, we then won at Chelsea and beat Leeds. We still weren\'t out of it but we were on the fringes of getting away from trouble, as it was the season when there was going to be four teams relegated. But our projected form from that moment on meant we would\'ve finished sixth or seventh. We really did come from nowhere to somewhere in a big way. \"The first thing I did when Willie Donachie [his assistant manager] and myself went in there was work on the defending. We\'d both taken away an armful of VHS tapes and we both came up with the same thing the next day - \'soft touch\'. So we were determined to make us hard to beat first and foremost. 21:45 Everton\'s famous 1995 FA Cup win over Manchester United, revisited on its 25th anniversary by two men who made it possible, Paul Rideout and Graham Stuart. Everton\'s famous 1995 FA Cup win over Manchester United, revisited on its 25th anniversary by two men who made it possible, Paul Rideout and Graham Stuart. \"Until the semi-final, I wouldn\'t say we weren\'t interested, but it certainly wasn\'t a major thing on our mind. When I got to the club the previous November, we were bottom of the table with just eight points from a third of the season. We were on schedule for 24 points unless there was an improvement, and thankfully there was. \"The players took on board what we wanted and we ended up with 50 points, but I was more scared of us getting an injury or a sending off as we didn\'t have that big a squad. The FA Cup was very much second on my mind until we beat Tottenham in the semi-finals.\" Everton secured their top-flight status with five days of the season remaining - a 1-0 win at Ipswich - while Manchester United missed out on retaining the Premier League title on the final day after only managing to draw 1-1 at West Ham as Blackburn were crowned champions. The team selection Royle: \"Managers and staff watch a lot of opposition videos nowadays but we all knew about United. We knew they were a top side having finished runners-up in the league to Blackburn. We actually frightened the life out of them when they beat us 2-1 on their way to the title and they still don\'t know how. We were no easy meat, and you could see that from the sides we beat to get to the final. \"We\'d already beaten Manchester United in the home game at Goodison Park, we\'d beaten Newcastle in the sixth round, we\'d beaten Spurs in the semi-final. \"Overall, we beat three Premier League sides to get to the final and when we got to Wembley to train before the game, we knew what we wanted and we knew what we were going to do - just the one thing that had to be sorted out was telling them the team. \"Unfortunately for John Ebbrell - who\'d played in most of the games to get us to that position but hadn\'t played in the semi-final - I had the terrible task of telling John he couldn\'t play. I had to go with the semi-final team and I knew the side we were going to play, it was just a matter of the system. \"But I had a good chat with the staff and decided 4-4-2 had got us there so we went with it. But the attitude at the hotel beforehand… we played header tennis, the lads were very relaxed. It only really got serious about an hour before kick-off. The team talk was quite simple - \'we\'ve got this far so come on then, we might as well win it.\'\" The road to Wembley Matt Jackson scored the opener in the 4-1 win over Tottenham in the semi-finals Royle: \"Quite often, you can get a soft draw, but we had the four Premier League sides and the biggest fright we had was at Bristol City. \"We only conceded one goal during the entire run and that was a penalty that never was against Spurs. That was the main thing about the team… we had the three midfield players [Joe Parkinson, Barry Horne, John Ebbrell], so we tightened up an awful lot. Everton\'s route to the final Third Round: Derby (H) Won 1-0 (Hinchcliffe) Fourth Round: Bristol City (A) Won 1-0 (Jackson) Fifth Round: Norwich (H) Won 5-0 (Limpar, Parkinson, Rideout, Ferguson, Stuart) Sixth Round: Newcastle (H) Won 1-0 (Watson) Semi-final: Tottenham (N) Won 4-1 (Jackson, Stuart, Amokachi 2) \"We were underdogs, but our hardest game and the one we looked most like losing was at Bristol City. I remember saying I hope we hadn\'t used up all our luck in one match after that. \"We had a bit of an illness in the squad and one player couldn\'t wait to get to the dressing room at half-time, and we had one or two injuries, so Bristol City must still be wondering how they didn\'t beat us that day. \"The pitch was awful… it was a bog. In the end, the oddities of what cup football throws up, Matt Jackson scored with a left-foot half volley. I\'ve never seen him hit a left-foot half volley before or since. Matt was a decidedly right-footed right back and he swung his leg at it and it was a great strike. It was a cup anomaly really.\" Daniel Amokachi substituted himself on at Elland Road - and scored twice Graham Stuart: \"The Tottenham performance was the best I\'ve ever been involved in as a professional footballer. When you look at the magnitude of the game and with it being a semi-final of the FA Cup. You\'ve got so much to gain and so much to lose in the space of 90 minutes. \"For us to rock up to Elland Road and to see our fans dominate the outside of the stadium and for us to then go out and dominate 90 minutes was monumental, really. We never looked like losing the game, we were so dominant and so confident. We had a good attitude and we weren\'t cocky but we had a little bit of arrogance about us in the sense that we just felt like we weren\'t going to lose the game. \"To then carry that onto Wembley and the icing on the cake was beating Man United in the final. It was a special time but the performance in the semi-final was far better than it was in the final.\" Paul Rideout: \"I injured my ACL so they were looking at it and assessing it at the time… Daniel [Amokachi] had made his way onto the field somehow, but in actual fact he did me a favour because I had damaged it and was struggling to make the final so in a way it was a blessing. When he came on, he produced two great goals and made the difference.\" Royle: \"I\'ve watched a lot of Everton, thinking back to the Bayern Munich game [3-1 win in the semi-final second leg of the European Cup Winners\' Cup in 1985], and I\'ve been involved in big games as a player, and that performance at Elland Road was fantastic. It was hard to see on the day who was the best player - it was that complete and we were so good all over the pitch. Joe Royle celebrates an Everton goal in the FA Cup semi-final victory \"When your sub comes on and scores twice, you know you\'ve got something going for you. It was the best substitution I\'ve never made! I had a code with Les Helm, who was a great football physio who wasn\'t keen on all the earplugs and microphones, so we had a code. He\'d go on if there was an injury, he\'d raise an arm to say, \'wait and see\', he\'d raise a thumb if he was going to be fine, or he\'d cut his throat with his finger to say \'he\'s finished!\' It was that simple. \"Rideout had gone down on the far side of the pitch and Les raised his hand and said he thought he was going to be OK if you give it a minute. He went off for treatment, so I just told Daniel to get warmed up in case. The next thing I knew, Danny substituted himself! I was running up the touchline saying, \'no, not yet\' - it wasn\'t that I didn\'t want Danny on the pitch, it\'s just that Rideout and Stuart as a pair were running riot. They were a great pair together, there\'s no doubt.\" The perfect partnership Match-winner Paul Rideout celebrates his strike in the first half at Wembley Stuart: \"Paul was a great technician. He could back into people. You look at somebody like Alan Shearer who was probably the best there was at it alongside Mark Hughes, Paul was really good at it as well. He\'d back into people, his technique was excellent, his first touch was very good and he had an awareness of how to bring people into the game. \"I could be in and around Paul knowing that he\'d be the focal point of attacks and I could pick up little bits and pieces off him.\" Rideout: \"Graham always read things really quickly - he understood the game so well and he anticipated things. The goal I should\'ve scored in the semi-final, he was already onto the rebound reading it. A major part of how we worked was the fact that everyone was connected. \"Willie Donachie came in and did a fabulous job, and all we did was work as a group. We had a midfield who would do anything for you. It was a good group and you trusted that everyone would do their job. We had special players like Anders Limpar who could change a game for you, so overall it was a well-connected group.\" Watson and the Everton team celebrate with the FA Cup at Wembley Royle: \"Stuart was terrific and one of the unsung heroes of the whole season. Terry Venables [the England manager] had asked about him. He never believes me, but Terry had mentioned him to me for England at the time, he was playing so well, along with Joe Parkinson and David Unsworth, who got one cap. \"Parky had terrible knee problems which would\'ve stopped him playing for England. He was the perfect holding midfield player, who could take the ball, pass the ball, very quick for his size, almost a centre-half but decidedly a holding midfield player. He was terrific that year.\" \"Technically, Paul was as good as any striker that was around. He gave us a great season, and Stuart rose above being a utility player to being one of the first names on the sheet. \"When Duncan [Ferguson] was fit, he had to play because he had that dynamic x-factor about him and nobody liked playing against Duncan, but as a pair, the movement between those two was terrific. Duncan wasn\'t fit for the semis, but he was fit for the final and came on.\" The Dogs of War The Dogs of War t-shirt denoting the vanquished is a collector\'s item Everton\'s run to Wembley is charted on the back as well as a call to arms Royle: \"A reporter asked me one day why Vinny Samways wasn\'t playing, who\'d been suspended when I got there, and I said we\'d just won three games in a row with the team. Quite honestly, I saw no reason to change it as we were playing in an aggressive way and that gave birth to the Dogs of War mentality. The next thing, there\'s Dogs of War t-shirts, there\'s all kinds of things. They\'re worth a few quid now.\" Stuart: \"I was alright with the Dogs of War label because I wasn\'t one of the dogs, but I don\'t know about John Ebbrell, Barry Horne and Joe Parkinson! \"But in all fairness to Joe, it was a bit of a flyaway comment that the press picked up upon - and it\'s no disrespect in any way, shape or form - in fact it\'s a compliment because every side needs the right balance. \"We had some very good talented players and we had a good workman-like group of players in those three. If a piece of paper flew across the pitch, they\'d tackle it, and that\'s the kind of mentality we had. Roy Keane is challenged by Joe Parkinson during Everton\'s 1-0 win \"They were so much better than that and they were very good at their jobs. They wouldn\'t let any midfield settle. We came up against a midfield of Paul Ince and Nicky Butt and they never let those lads settle at any time. They were a vital cog in our wheel. \"It wasn\'t just about me and Paul as we were well-drilled as a unit. The training we went about on a daily basis was such that everybody knew their individual job so as soon as the opposition goalkeeper had the ball in his hands, me or Paul - whoever was nearest - was at them. \"It\'s great when you\'ve got a midfield who you know are going to back you up and you\'re not going to see that the midfield are 20 yards away, you know the work in closing them down isn\'t going to be a waste of time. That\'s the way we were drilled.\" On to Wembley... Manchester United captain Steve Bruce greets Dave Watson at the coin toss Rideout: \"I\'d only ever previously been to Wembley to play as a schoolboy. I remember watching Southampton win the FA Cup [in 1976] and I felt we were in the same situation with Everton playing against Man United. When I came away from watching that game, I thought \'that\'s where I want to be\'. \"You don\'t get too many opportunities to do it, and when we played against Tottenham, we were relaxed because the pressure wasn\'t on us. Having Man United just lose the league, this was their last chance to win silverware so the pressure was on them. \"I just enjoyed the whole day - there was never any nervousness that you would usually associate with a game like that. I just felt good about the day and obviously winning makes you remember everything about it, but to a certain extent the survival of Everton in the league was more important to us. Once we did that, it was a big relaxing moment to go to Wembley just to enjoy.\" Neville Southall saves smartly at the feet of Nicky Butt as Everton held on Stuart: \"We went down to London a couple of days before the final. Big Joe just wanted the atmosphere to be relaxed. We were in the hotel and ticked along with a little bit of training. We were as fit as we were going to be anyway, so it was more a case of keeping loose and enjoying each other\'s company. We turned up at Wembley knowing we were the underdogs, but we didn\'t feel in our dressing room. \"We knew that if we gave out a good performance, then we would be close to winning the game. We were quietly confident about ourselves and that\'s what we did on the day. We went out and gave it our best shot. Perhaps we caught Man United on a slightly underperforming day. \"You\'re never going to play Man United and dominate for 90 minutes… they\'re too good a side and there\'s too many talented players. But when we needed the Neville Southalls and Dave Watsons and the Barry Hornes, they stood up for us. Ryan Giggs was a second-half sub for the Premier League runners-up \"Paul gets the credit, and rightly so for his goal, and the attacking players usually get the credit, but I think ultimately when we needed them, our back four was absolutely outstanding in that last half an hour at the game at Wembley.\" Royle: \"Late on, Neville had a bit to do but I thought there was nothing in it during the first half. Alex [Ferguson] in one of his books later referred to it as a very ordinary final played by two ordinary teams which I thought was a bit harsh on us, but he\'s my mate so I\'m not going to say anything more than that. \"I thought we were good on the day… it wasn\'t the glossy, flowing performance of the semi-final, but it certainly was a good performance against a top side. Duncan had two great chances when he came on so it could\'ve been more in the end although Neville made a couple of important saves.\" The winner Gary Ablett, Barry Horne, Jackson, Rideout, Graham Stuart and Amokachi Rideout: \"The goal was in slow motion. The build-up was from a deep position, and we were real quick. Anders went with the ball up the field and Matt Jackson made a great over-lap. He played the ball in and I heard a shout from Graham from behind me in a lot of space, so I dummied the ball, and went back in to pick up the pieces. Thankfully, it didn\'t go in and dropped nicely for me. \"At that particular time, when it came back off the crossbar, it seemed a long time because it just bounced up and was sitting there in the air. You just take a chance of putting everything into it, and hope that it goes in. \"The sad part about it - and I always think about this - is the celebration afterwards, no knowing what to do. It was a pretty sad celebration, I\'ve got to admit [Rideout held his arms aloft and blew a kiss to the crowd]. But when you score at Wembley, it\'s a special place. Everton captain Dave Watson holds aloft the FA Cup alongside Southall \"To score the winning goal, and to score it against Man United is even more special because they were a special team. It\'s a great memory for me, I have lived off it for 25 years and it\'s all thanks to Graham! \"That said, winning the FA Cup now compared to where it was, it\'s totally different. It was such a big event then. It\'s still big, but it\'s nowhere near what it was, which is a bit of a sad thing.\" The after-party Anders Limpar and Amokachi were two of the stars of the Cup success Royle: \"The team knew how to celebrate. Duncan was a great party leader when it came to celebrations, and he loved it. They all did, and even Anders Limpar bless him who didn\'t drink… he had a drink that night. He was quite poorly the next day. He had a great final and was in great form.\" Stuart: \"I can remember the celebrations that night up to about 10 o\'clock and then it\'s all just a blur. The one thing that stands out for me was that it wasn\'t so much the celebrations on the night but the next morning. \"We were up at 10.30am the next day to go back up to Merseyside for the open-top bus parade. A crate of Labatts beer was opened on the way up and the rest is history! Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Andy Hinchcliffe both featured \"The FA Cup was paraded around Burger King on the M6 somewhere, it was great as the spirit we had at the time - we were as good on the park as we were off it. We were in the Royal Lancaster hotel on the Saturday night, and all our families were invited to the evening do. \"My two sisters were with me, and I\'ll never forget it. There was a bit of a kerfuffle in the corner of the hotel and everybody surrounded this table to the sight of Duncan Ferguson in his kilt, lifting it up to the tune that was going on with the DJ at the time. \"I was searching for my two sisters, and where did I find them? Right at the front of the queue in front of Duncan Ferguson. They were quickly marched back to my table…\" What happened next? Substitute Duncan Ferguson celebrates with the FA Cup at Wembley Everton lifted the Charity Shield courtesy of a 1-0 win over Blackburn at the start of the following season but they were knocked out of the second round of the European Cup Winners\' Cup by Feyenoord having beaten KR Reykjavik in round one. They finished the Premier League season in sixth place after a shock fourth-round exit in the FA Cup to Port Vale... Rideout: \"We did well the following season finishing sixth in the league, compared to where we were the season before but we didn\'t have the money we have now to follow that through. They did invest quite heavily in signing Andrei Kanchelskis and a couple of others, but it wasn\'t enough to keep it going. \"After that season, for me, I was on my way out anyway, but I was expecting them to push on after finishing sixth. Sadly, it didn\'t happen. It\'s tragic that we haven\'t won anything in 25 years. Time has flown by, but you still remember the day vividly and it was a great day. \"You look at Everton now and the money they\'ve spent and the squads that they\'ve had… we had a good squad, but it wasn\'t a deep squad. I\'ve been looking over the years thinking we\'ve been getting stronger and stronger and yet we still haven\'t won anything. It\'s just mystifying for me.\" Liverpool fans taunt their Merseyside rivals at this year\'s FA Cup tie Stuart: \"What we\'ve got at Everton now is a set of really good lads with a great attitude and a great desire but maybe just not the know-how to get over the line. \"Paul talks about us in 1995 having quite a shallow squad, but within that squad we had a good set of players that had a really strong mentality, a huge desire to win, a great working attitude and a sprinkling of magic dust as well.\" Also See: Can Carlo end Everton\'s trophy wait?

B/R\'s Dean Jones has done extensive reporting on this, relaying the thoughts of chairmen, executives and managers who all agree cash is going to be short, wages are going to have to drop and that perhaps football\'s bubble has burst; that an unsustainable business is now going to undergo a hard reset. Even superclubs are affected. Manchester United\'s pursuit of Jadon Sancho has turned into a patient waiting game, Arsenal are going to have to get even more creative with their budget, while Barcelona are staring financial peril in the face. One method mooted to help cope with the cash shortage is player swap deals—something we saw an increase in during the 2019 summer transfer window, and that could become even more common in 2020. Another is looking down the leagues. The clubs further down the football pyramid will be affected even more than those at the top, so not only could looking in their direction be a good way of securing homegrown talent for a lower price, but the wages may be more manageable too. It\'s a point alluded to by Ben Lyttleton, author of Edge: What Business Can Learn From Football, in B/R\'s look at Barcelona\'s finances this week: \"There will be more opportunities for clubs to give younger players a chance to keep the wage bills down. We\'ll see clubs trying to move on players with good deals. We\'ll see more swap deals, more loans. There will be a change in how the market will operate. There will be opportunities for smart clubs to find value.\" So let\'s cast our eyes down the English leagues and hunt for those potential gems. The next Dele Allis, if you will. We\'ve enlisted Round World Royals director Harry Brooks, an independent coach who has worked personally with several players in the lower leagues, in addition to more established names, such as Steven Bergwijn. He\'s helped assess five players from England\'s lower leagues that could step up to a top-six Premier League level, adding some suggested good fits along the way. Kalvin Phillips, 24, Defensive Midfielder, Leeds United James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images Ever since Marcelo Bielsa was appointed Leeds United manager, player success stories have come thick and fast. Almost everyone has improved immeasurably under his tutelage, with Phillips perhaps the shiniest example of them all. A snappy, aggressive, athletic midfielder, his presence in the centre of the park goes a long way to making Leeds an uncomfortable opponent to play against. He racks up the tackles and interceptions (4.1 per game combined) and sets a platform of dominance in the middle. In 2018-19 he split time between midfield and defence, operating as a central defender in a back three at times, showcasing a versatility and positional awareness that adds to his allure. Aston Villa were one of several sides to bid for him last summer, per The Sun, with the sum around the £15 million mark. He\'s only improved, so if Leeds don\'t get promoted in 2020, even bigger fish will likely enter the ring for him. Brooks\' View The top sides aim to win the ball back fast, and Phillips would suit that style. He\'s an extremely intense presser of the ball and will lock on to opponents like a shadow, attempting to win it back as quickly as possible. The game is becoming quicker and more intense, with teams looking for athletic runners on and off the ball. Phillips suits this. His mobility and ability to cover ground quickly would see him thrive in the Premier League. His passing ability is mixed: He regularly floats longer passes to either flank but rarely distributes and passes through the centre of the pitch and could work on his willingness to break lines with passes. He also needs to prove he can take the more measured approach and be positionally disciplined to cover space. Good Fits: Arsenal, Wolves Said Benrahma, 24, Winger, Brentford Alex Burstow/Getty Images Another Championship player who is attracting interest from above is Benrahma—Jones reports that Leicester City like the look of him—and that checks out. He looks totally out of place in the second tier. Ten goals and 14 assists from 29 starts last season and 10 and 7 from 30, respectively, so far this term speaks to his attacking output. He\'s a goalscorer and a creator, regularly chipping in and helping the strikers decide games. Defenders have no idea how to handle him; he\'s too quick, too silky and boasts too much of a variety in his play to stop. He can dribble, he can pass, he can shoot and he can roam across the pitch to look for space. Allowed to blossom and shine at Brentford, given freedom to move and interpret, he\'s developed into some player. Brooks\' View Regularly deployed as a left winger who is also comfortable on the right, Benrahma is afforded the freedom to roam centrally and move between the lines. On the ball, his skill, ability to change tempo and stand players up attracts several opponents toward him, where he often wriggles away and looks to exploit the space vacated. Most sides in the Premier League are intense defensively, whether it\'s pressing high with aggression, or compactly in a mid block or low block, so Benrahma\'s press resistance is an important trait that should mean he makes the step up well. He has good vision and can split defences with forward passes, so would suit a side that has players willing to run ahead of the ball. However, he may need to work on his own runs ahead of the ball, rather than constantly looking to receive to feet. Good Fits: Leicester City, Everton, Aston Villa Kane Vincent-Young, 24, Right-Back, Ipswich Town James Baylis - AMA/Getty Images Probably the least recognisable name on this list is Vincent-Young\'s, who dropped down the Football League in order to rise back up—Rickie Lambert style—to the top. He has the profile of a modern full-back or wing-back, combining size and speed, along with sound technique, to dominate his flank. He mixes aggression and trickery when dribbling, throwing in feints and step-overs along with more powerful thrusts. He\'s shown an eye for goal (scoring a spectacular one vs. Tranmere Rovers) and a willingness to arrive at the back post for crosses. He stands up defensively, too, with his athleticism making him tough to beat. Brooks\' View Despite never playing higher than League One to date, it is just a matter of time before Vincent-Young reaches the top tier. My colleague Richard Webster has trained Vincent-Young on a one-to-one basis since he was 13, in the Spurs academy, and I have been part of his recent journey. He has the technique, athleticism and game-understanding needed to play in the Premier League and is able to provide attacking impetus in a variety of ways. Vincent-Young\'s technique and ball manipulation means he can carry the ball infield as well as outside through composed dribbling. His athleticism and balance also enables him to drive forward aggressively with pace. He can receive the ball deep to feet and drive up the pitch, or he can make forward runs ahead of the ball and receive high. He could still work on delivering crosses deep and early, though, as he usually prefers to stand his man up one-on-one. Good Fits: Tottenham Jude Bellingham, 16, Midfielder, Birmingham City Nathan Stirk/Getty Images For a 16-year-old to play a full campaign at senior level, rucking with fully grown adults every week, is quite something. Few can handle it physically, few can handle it mentally, yet Bellingham frequently looks a cut above on any pitch he walks out on—and he\'s still on a youth contract worth £145 per week, per The Guardian. Jones has reported Manchester United are, understandably, hot on his heels. Borussia Dortmund have expressed major interest too. He\'s shown class on the ball, a high level understanding of movement, physicality and rare positional versatility, having already fulfilled multiple roles in the Blues\' midfield in 2019-20. He\'s a super young talent. Brooks\' View Bellingham has an incredible temperament and maturity on the football pitch, and those traits in particular are why he\'s become a first-team regular despite still only being 16. His game-understanding is outstanding. Whether he plays as a No. 6, No. 8 or a No. 10, he knows what to do in every situation. He has superb composure, his timing on the ball defies his tender years, and he can receive behind and ahead of the ball—a trait not many midfielders possess, let alone at 16. As Bellingham gets older, and no doubt joins one of the elite sides, he may have to find a home in a more specific role. \"Role-fillers\" are sought-after, and his ability to perform in a variety of them is a huge positive, but he will have to find a position to call home to establish himself at Premier League level, or in another major European division. Good Fits: Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool...everyone should be in for him Eberechi Eze, 21, Attacking Midfielder, Queens Park Rangers Andrew Redington/Getty Images This season, Eze has emerged as one of the stars of the Championship. He\'s one of best players in the division and perhaps the best to watch too. The way he glides across the pitch, carries the ball and ghosts past defenders draws you to the edge of your seat. With 20 goal contributions—12 goals, eight assists—under his belt this season, he\'s backing up some pretty play and clever off-the-ball movement with tangible production. Operating out of a relative free role, be it from behind the striker or cutting in off the left, his arced right-footed finishes are Ashley Young-esque, and his stuttered penalty-taking technique is prime Eden Hazard. Brooks\' View An extremely creative and dynamic dribbler, Eze is a rarity: He has superb skill but also an ability to aggressively carry and drive the ball up the pitch too. It\'s not always silky, but it\'s always effective and positive. He\'s comfortable receiving the ball in a variety of ways, in a variety of positions, while still managing to play forward as often as possible. He can lay it off first time, roll you, drop a shoulder or face you up and drive at you. His end product comes in a number of forms: he can score different types of goals but also create by threading passes into the final third. The ingenuity, unpredictability and dynamism he possesses makes him very difficult to stop. Like Benrahma, he thrives off the ability to express himself and be free. He may have to prove he can operate in a more structured setup in a higher league. Good fits: Tottenham, Wolves Listen to Sam every Wednesday on the B/R Football Ranks podcast. Subscribe here.

According to the Corriere dello Sport, it means Higuain and Rabiot will be allowed back into the training centre tomorrow. They returned later than the others from abroad, so needed to go into quarantine. However, the rules have been relaxed lately, giving them the all-clear if they have two negative swab tests in 48 hours.

That includes 17 of 32 starting quarterbacks. In fact, 10 teams thought so little of the final dress rehearsal for the season that they didn\'t play their first- or second-string quarterback a single snap. If you bought a seat for Tampa Bay-Washington Wednesday night, 60 players sat it out, including Robert Griffin III. In Philadelphia, 66 players on the Jets and Eagles didn\'t play. And 62 Bears and Browns didn\'t get their hands, or uniforms, dirty in Cleveland Thursday night, despite the fans paying regular season prices for the schlock that is preseason football. Sean Canfield started at quarterback for the Saints at Tennessee Thursday. Cut the next day. Quarterback Dominique Davis played 60 minutes for someone Thursday. Guess who? (And no sharing the answer, Falcons fans.) I mention all of this because I sense the league is finally getting fed up with it. I don\'t know when it\'s coming, but I can sense it -- the 32 teams changing their practice of charging regular season prices for some of the intrasquad-scrimmage-quality games we see every August, particularly during the final preseason week. I can\'t tell you if it\'ll be season-ticket holders being asked to buy only nine games instead of the 10 (eight regular season, two preseason) they now purchase, or if the price of the 10th game on every ticket package will be radically reduced. But I can see sometime this fall, once the officiating conundrum is settled, the NFL working on a way to not rip off the customers it says it cares so much about. My proposal: Charge eight games at full price. Charge a ninth game, one of the two currently scheduled home preseason games, at half price. And the other home preseason game won\'t exist anymore; it\'d be a scrimmage, on one of the first two weekends of the preseason, at a regional venue, for $10 per ticket. Each team brings 50 of the 90 players fighting for roster spots. Here are some examples using the first weekend of the recently completed preseason: Pittsburgh-Philadelphia at Penn State. Washington-Buffalo at Syracuse. Cleveland-Detroit at Toledo. Tampa Bay-Miami at Orlando. Minnesota-San Francisco at Jim Harbaugh\'s old place, Stanford. St. Louis-Indy at Notre Dame. For some games, have fun. Baltimore-Atlanta (with all the Alabama players Ozzie Newsome drafts, and Julio Jones on the Falcons) on the Alabama campus at Tuscaloosa. How about Tennessee versus Seattle at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wis., with Russell Wilson fighting for playing time for the Seahawks? The possibilities, and potential NFL goodwill, would be endless. So there\'s that. And a Happy Labor Day to you all. Maybe next year you season-ticket holders will not be forced to pay for the games you hate so much. *** Now for the news of the week ... All officials, all the time. Another story showcasing these fine, upstanding men in the striped pajamas, aka the replacement officials: I cannot say which game this story happened in, but I can tell you it did happen. Final preseason game for two teams. Official calls defensive pass-interference in front of the penalized team\'s bench. Head coach lambastes the official. Official picks up the flag, tells the coach he\'s not going to make the call. Coach is stunned. Imagine what will happen when something\'s actually at stake. I really thought the ref lockout would end when the league sent a memo to every team last Wednesday telling teams that replacement officials would work the first weekend of games. Now the impasse was on the verge of costing each official $8,000 a week, on average. If you recall the way the league dealt with the players in 2011, you recall nothing ever happened until the very last minute. Thursday and Friday were the equivalent of 10 minutes before midnight. Each side knew that to get the real refs back for the Wednesday night opener, the deal would have to be done by either late Sunday or early Monday. According to a memo sent to all the teams on Sunday and obtained by SI.com, Commissioner Roger Goodell called one of the officials\' negotiators, ref Jeff Triplette, and Triplette came to New York to speak with the league\'s negotiators directly. The league\'s memo attests that, \"In the course of discussions on Friday morning, Mr. Triplette quantified the economic gap between the parties as approximately $4 million per year for compensation and retirement benefits combined. The Commissioner advised Mr. Triplette that in order to obtain an agreement this weekend, so that the regular officials could begin to work next week, we would close the deal by agreeing to provide an additional $1 million per year, which could be used to improve either base compensation or our proposal regarding retirement benefits ... \"The increase offered to settle the labor dispute could be valued in several ways. Assuming a staff of 120 game officials, an additional $1 million would fund an $8,000 increase in the average game official\'s annual compensation. Alternatively, it would increase the annual defined contribution to an official\'s retirement account by $8,000. If the officials preferred, the additional money could have been divided between base compensation and retirement benefits ... \"Commissioner Goodell expressly stated that the additional money was being offered to conclude a deal now so the officials could be on the field for the start of the regular season. He said that the officials should not schedule further meetings unless they were prepared to settle on that basis. In other words, the increase in the offer was to settle now -- it was not to set a new floor for a new round of negotiations.\'\' Triplette, according to the NFL, said another negotiating official, Scott Green, and attorney Michael Arnold would come to New York to continue the negotiations on Saturday -- to, as the NFL memo said, \"conclude an agreement within the parameters that had been discussed earlier on Friday.\" Later Sunday, the officials\' union, the NFL Referees Association, said the NFL\'s claim that Triplette made any agreement with the league was \"absolutely false.\'\' \"The NFLRA was prepared to discuss all remaining issues to reach a fair CBA,\'\' the officials\' statement said. \"However, the NFL provided an ultimatum that the NFLRA abandon its positions on all issues other than compensation in return for the possibility that the NFL would modestly increase its offer. The NFLRA put forth a compensation alternative that was immediately rejected by the NFL .... The NFLRA asked the NFL to discuss other alternatives to resolve the pension issue. The NFL rejected that request. Having refused to negotiate until the 11th hour, the NFL has chosen a tactic of personal attacks on the leadership of the NFLRA.\'\' The pension part of the negotiations, I\'m told, is a non-starter for the league. The large majority of full-time NFL employees have 401k-based pensions, not the defined-benefit pensions the officials have now, and the league wants to change over to the 401k model. The NFL doesn\'t want part-time employees, many of whom have pensions at their other jobs, to have a better pension system than full-time NFL employees. If the officials would drop their pension demand -- that the current officials be grandfathered in to the more advantageous pension plan, while newly hired officials would have 401k pensions -- this dispute would probably end quickly. There\'s one more hurdle. The NFL wants to hire a farm system of about 20 officials to train new officials and also to provide a \"bench\'\' so the league could replace underperforming officials if their performance warranted. But it doesn\'t sound from either side like that\'s a deal-breaker, because the league dismisses underperforming officials after every season anyway. Stay tuned. It seems highly unlikely the logjam will break before Wednesday. *** Two days until football. Real football. The Giants and Cowboys play Wednesday night, opening the NFL\'s 93rd season. One of the best conversations I had on my camp tour this summer was with Dallas coach Jason Garrett about Eli Manning. Garrett, being a former quarterback himself and tutoring a pretty good one in Tony Romo in Dallas, has strong opinions about what makes a quarterback good. Garrett thinks surviving adversity and being able to bring your team back late are two of the biggest signposts to quarterback greatness. For instance, he thinks one of the great games Romo\'s ever played is a five-interception job at Buffalo on a Monday night five seasons ago. \"Because he struggled for a long time in that game, he hung in, he came back twice in the fourth quarter from deficits, and he found a way to get it done,\'\' Garrett said. Manning, Garrett said, has a reputation for being the perfect fourth-quarter quarterback. \"People write all the time how great Eli is late, like he\'s never lost a game in the fourth quarter,\'\' Garrett said. \"That\'s inaccurate. He has. He\'s made some bad mistakes late, with some bad interceptions at the wrong times. But it\'s the NFL. The NFL\'s hard. And Eli has come back to play well so many times in big games, which is one of the things I really admire about him. \"As much as the big plays -- like the throw he made against the Patriots down the sideline late for [Mario] Manningham -- what impresses me are the little plays. The consecutive passes he completed in the first half of the Super Bowl, just keeping [Tom Brady] off the field and moving the ball so efficiently. He plays the game so well from the shoulders up.\'\' Seems to run in the family. Could this be the year Baltimore\'s offense actually is better than the D? I can see it. The Ravens don\'t have a strong pass rush without Terrell Suggs. I\'m through writing off Ray {Freak of Nature] Lewis, but he\'s 37, and Ed Reed turns 34 next week. At some point, if Joe Flacco\'s going to convince the world he\'s a big-timer, he has to play big with an offense that doesn\'t lead the league in weaponry. That sometime might be this year. And Flacco might just be his best this season because he should be playing no-huddle, and playing fast, for much of the season. Flacco ran the no-huddle most often in college at Delaware, but hasn\'t done that much of it as a pro. He told me last week he\'s \"looking at our offense as total no-huddle ... as 100 percent no-huddle.\'\' Look at the advantages this could bring Baltimore. Count them: 1. Jim Caldwell, the new Ravens quarterback coach, has come from the laboratory of the no-huddle with Peyton Manning in Indianapolis. For seven years, from 2002 to 2008, he was Manning\'s quarterback coach; for the following three, he was head coach of the Colts. That\'s nine prime seasons (not counting 2011, obviously) that Caldwell was heavily involved the best no-huddle offense the NFL has ever seen. 2. Flacco looks faster in the no-huddle this preseason, in part because he likes it so much. You\'d never put Flacco in the top five of quick quarterback decision-makers, based on what you\'ve seen to this point in his four NFL seasons. He\'s not plodding, but he\'s not RGIII-like either. But he\'s looked rhythmic in the preseason in this new offense. Against Jacksonville in the Ravens\' third preseason game, Flacco ran 48 plays in 36 minutes, about 41 of them in the no-huddle offense. (First plays of series, or play after timeouts, are usually run after huddling.) Jacksonville\'s defense is pretty good -- sixth in the league last year -- but Flacco raced to a 20-3 lead against them by the time he exited, with just over 24 minutes to play. The Jaguars, from the looks of the Baltimore pace, just couldn\'t match the Ravens\' tempo. 3. Baltimore has the personnel to run the no-huddle, and to stretch the opposing D. The Ravens will start two speed receivers on the outside -- second-year man Torrey Smith and ex-Texan Jacoby Jones -- with Anquan Boldin in the slot and Ed Dickson and red-zone threat Dennis Pitta at tight end. And from the first of OTAs, the team has been concentrating on the no-huddle, practicing it constantly. 4. Baltimore\'s arch rival, the Steelers, has some age on defense. The Ravens think it\'s an advantage to keep Pittsburgh\'s defensive starters on the field. Why? Seven of them are past 30. It\'s an obvious edge to the no-huddle: Tire foes out. 5. The side benefit of the no-huddle, other than to tire out the defense, is to limit substitution and make the defense simplify what it does. Without the substitution, and with the fast pace of the offense, defenders probably aren\'t going to be as imaginative in play-calls. They just want to survive. \"I think the no-huddle can add a couple of minutes to the game for us,\'\' Flacco said. \"I think we could get another possession per game out of it. The bottom line is, I\'m happy we\'re doing it. Very happy. Defenses have gotten so complicated. When you slow it down and get into a huddle before every play, you\'re playing into their hands, allowing them to dictate the tempo of the game. This way, we take control of the game.\'\' Another reason quarterbacks like the no-huddle is it puts so much in the quarterback\'s hands. \"I never dreamed I\'d be giving the quarterback so much independence,\'\' said Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy, which I wrote about in the SI NFL preview issue. But that\'s just what McCarthy\'s done. And I think he\'ll give Aaron Rodgers more of the no-huddle this year. \"We just might,\'\' Rodgers said with a sly smile at training camp. In Baltimore\'s no-huddle, when Flacco has a three-by-one look -- three receivers to one side, one to the other -- he\'ll have a choice of four or five passes to throw. He knows which one is likely to work depending on which defense he sees across the line. He can back up from center and change the play. He can back up and change the protection. He can dictate a change simply by how he calls the cadence. \"It puts a lot on the quarterback,\'\' said Flacco, \"but that\'s something I really like.\'\' One more thing: Ray Rice is a very good receiver out of the backfield. With a system Flacco prefers to run, I wouldn\'t be surprised if he raises his mediocre completion percentage (57.6 last year) and looks like a different player. When you like doing something, you throw more of yourself into it. I also don\'t see it as much of a possibility that Flacco plays anywhere else, at least in the foreseeable future. His contract expires after this year, and there\'s been some gnashing of teeth in Baltimore that he\'s entering his final year without a deal being done. \"I\'m not obsessing about it,\'\' he said. \"If I was obsessing about it, I\'d have held out. I\'m optimistic I\'ll get paid one way or the other, and I anticipate I\'ll be here a long time. Once I sign, I\'m pretty sure I\'ll be here for the long haul.\'\' *** The NFL and the Army make a pact, but will it work? Last Thursday, an hour up the Hudson River from NFL offices in New York, the Army and the NFL signed an agreement to share medical research about concussions and head trauma. The theory is simple: Soldiers in battle are dealing more and more with the impact of concussions, and all military branches are training their troops to know the warning signs of head injuries. In football, players are being taught to recognize the signs of head trauma and concussions, and are being told to leave the game when they\'ve been concussed. When Goodell and Gen. Raymond Odierno, the Army Chief of Staff, met at West Point Thursday, they had much in common. Both are dealing with employees who, left to themselves, most often won\'t admit they\'re having trouble after being hit in the head. Guess which man, Goodell or Odierno, said this during a panel discussion about head trauma in football and the military: \"I worry about our leaders more than anything else. They\'re the ones who won\'t take themselves out. They feel the burden of leadership.\'\' It was Odierno speaking, but those are the sentiments that have worried those in the NFL who legitimately want to address the problem. Odierno and Goodell both said they had programs in place that would make it easier for employees to self-report a problem, and, in fact, encourage them to report a problem. \"We need these policies to protect us from ourselves,\'\' former player and now NFL executive Troy Vincent said Thursday. \"You stay on the field in the heat of battle.\'\' And former Giants and Niner Bart Oates said he\'d stay in the game if he had a concussion, and would try to hide it from teammates if need be. \"Culture changes don\'t happen overnight,\'\' Goodell said. For them to happen at all, technology will have to help. The Army is spending liberally now to do some research that interests the NFL very much. One of the areas: trying to discover if biomarkers can determine through small blood samples from pin-pricks whether a person has been concussed or is undergoing head trauma. The merging of medical minds makes sense, and the technology on the Army\'s side should help NFL players in recovery from, and treatment of, head trauma. But it won\'t be a perfect solution until players do what Kurt Warner did during his last year in football -- leave one game and choose to sit the next despite not being forced to sit by a doctor. Warner feared the long-term impact of head trauma, and he remembers the questioning looks from his teammates, as in, Are you really hurt? But he thought more of his future than his present. It\'s a lesson players and soldiers need to learn better. \"Pride has no place for certain injuries,\'\' said Army Staff Sgt. Shawn Hibbard, who has taken troops into battle in Afghanistan. \"You get hit by a 500-pound bomb, you probably have to come out.\'\' Same goes for getting hit in the head by a 260-pound middle linebacker. That\'s why the NFL and the Army make a good match. *** Odds and ends entering the season. I wanted to let you know about my weekly schedule, and when you can expect to read, see and hear me, and how you can help me make this column better in 2012. First, Monday Morning Quarterback enters its 16th season on the web, making it -- I believe -- the longest-running Internet column on the NFL. I\'ll have a couple of new things this year. One: In cooperation with ProFootballFocus.com, I\'m going to have a piece of the column each week focusing on one of the key matchups of the weekend. Maybe it\'s a receiver-cornerback matchup, or how a defense tries to pen in a mobile quarterback, or how an offense tries to use no-huddle to dictate to the defense. Each week, I\'ll find a subplot you\'ll all be talking about, and ProFootballFocus.com will do the studying and provide you an inside look at one of the compelling angles of the NFL weekend. Two: This is where you come in. I am going to allow readers of this column -- via email or on Twitter @SI_PeterKing -- to suggest a segment of the column you\'d like to see. Maybe it\'s Good Guy of the Week, Overrated Bum of the Week, Invisible Offensive Lineman of the Week, Coaching Decision You\'d Never Have Made, etc. You suggest it to me, and next week, in the first regular season week of the column, I\'ll pick one and implement it, and we\'ll see how it goes. (The examples I just gave ... just throwing things out there. Come up with any idea you\'d like.) Send me your ideas by Thursday of this week and I\'ll pick one. Thanks for that. So here\'s the weekly lineup: Monday: Monday Morning Quarterback, posted weekly by 8:30 a.m. (I hope.) Tuesday: By noon, my Tuesday column and email bag should be posted on SI.com ... And late in the afternoon, the SI NFL Podcast with Peter King will be up on iTunes and SI.com. My special guests for Week 1: Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Arizona wideout Larry Fitzgerald. I\'ll have a guest spot in the morning on Colin Cowherd\'s radio show on ESPN, and a longer one in the afternoons (4 p.m. Eastern, most likely) with Chris Russo on \"Mad Dog Radio\'\' on SiriusXM Channel 86. Wednesday (This week only): Debut of Football Night in America before Giants-Cowboys at the Meadowlands. Every week, I\'ll also be doing a Midweek Report video for SI.com. Thursday: My weekly game picks on SI.com (By the way, you have the chance to take me on in fantasy each week this year in our new Peter King Fantasy Challenge) ... Radio spot with Mitch Levy on KJR in Seattle at 7 a.m. Pacific. Friday: My Friday Game Plan column previewing the weekend\'s games will be posted on SI.com, along with my Final Word video ... Radio spot with Mut and Merloni on WEEI in Boston at noon Eastern ... NBC Sports Network NFL programming, live from NBC Sports Network studios in Stamford, Conn., from 5-7 p.m., with Mike Florio, whose Pro Football Talk Live show will air from 5-6 p.m., followed by an hour of football talk with Doug Flutie, Hines Ward, me and others. Saturday: In the NBC Studios in New York for seven Notre Dame football halftime shows, with Mike Florio. Sunday: In the NBC studios in New York for Football Night in America prep work, and the show, at 7 p.m. Eastern ... Then a night of writing. Should be fun. Send me your ideas for MMQB. Excited about getting my 29th season covering the NFL underway. *** The kid went and did it. Well, in the span of seven months, Ohio\'s beaten Michigan in basketball and Penn State in football. That\'s a little heady for my alma mater. Actually, it\'s a lot heady. I introduced you to the kid in the middle of the football headiness, quarterback Tyler Tettleton, last week, and I figured you\'d want to hear his reaction after Ohio 24, Penn State 14, with Ohio churning out 499 yards of total offense and Tettleton a 31-of-41 afternoon. Tettleton was, well, reserved Sunday afternoon, 24 hours after walking off the field in Unhappy Valley. \"It really didn\'t hit me \'til today, what we did,\'\' Tettleton said from his apartment in Athens. \"I got back and watched the highlights on TV and said, \'Wow, we beat Penn State.\' \"The day, the whole scene, was great. When we got to the stadium, you could just feel how they were ready to move on and start a new era. They were so into it. So spirited. They were some of the best fans, all of them. In the pregame, I felt the emotion, but once the game started, all of that went out the window. It was another game. You\'re just playing.\'\' Down 14-3 in the third quarter, the 6-foot Tettleton had OU at the Penn State 43. Third and seven. He threw a ball off his back foot, slightly behind wideout Landon Smith. As soon as the ball left his hand, Tettleton wanted to slap himself. He said he thought, Oh crap. Why\'d I do that? \"Probably one of the dumbest throws I\'ve made in a while,\'\' he said. The ball ricocheted off a Penn State defender\'s hands, into Smith\'s, and Smith ran for a 43-yard touchdown. \"You saved me!\'\' Tettleton told Smith. More Tettleton: \"After the game I kind of thought I might be all emotional, but I wasn\'t. I saw my mom, and she hugged me. She was in tears. She knew this was what I wanted, the chance to play in games like this. Then we got on the bus. It was five and a half hours back to campus.\'\' Tettleton and his mates were the toasts of Court Street, the main street in Athens where the team went to be patted on the back around 11 Saturday night. Rumor has it the students had had a few beers before the team arrived. \"What\'s the weirdest sight you saw on Court Street?\'\' I asked. He thought a few seconds. \"The weirdest thing ... well, I\'d say seeing people wearing my jersey. I mean, I can\'t get used to that. It\'s crazy. I don\'t like the spotlight much. I\'m just glad we were able to do this for the university. I\'m blessed to be here. I always think of the programs that passed on me because they didn\'t think I could do it. These coaches took a shot on me.\'\' Tettleton sounded like an NFL quarterback, the more he talked. \"Penn State\'s over,\'\' he said. \"Now it\'s time to focus on New Mexico State.\'\' *** Cause of the Week. I\'ll be running my second half-marathon on Sept. 29, the Hamptons Half-Marathon on eastern Long Island ... assuming I don\'t break something (like my spirit) in training beforehand. I\'m running to benefit retired NFL special-teamer Steve Gleason\'s efforts to build an ALS House in the city of New Orleans -- an inpatient residence to serve patients with neuro-muscular diseases and allow them to live as independently as possible. Gleason is living with ALS, having been diagnosed with the disease in 2011, and figures the residence will cost between $750,000 and $1 million to build and maintain. He has plans to open it within the next six months, but he needs money to do that, and that\'s where you come in. (Actually, JP Morgan Chase is on the verge of chipping in a good chunk of the funding, but much more is needed.) My goal is probably a silly one: I want to raise $50,000 for the ALS House. But I figure quite a few of you read the column, and I\'ll promote it here and on Twitter, and if you can give $5 or $10 or $100, I\'ll take anything you can muster and be eternally grateful. I\'m pledging a minimum of $1,000 to the cause -- that\'s if I finish the run in 2 hours 20 minutes or less. I\'ll give an additional $1,000 if I either don\'t finish or run slower than 2:20. I\'ve already thrown in the first $1,000. As Gleason has said to me: \"Hope you\'re really slow that day.\" Here\'s how you can contribute. Thanks for your support. If you can\'t contribute, send some good conditioning karma my way. I\'ll need it. In my last race, in New Hampshire in 2010, I finished a few seconds faster than 2:20. Judging by my 10-mile plod through Central Park and beyond Saturday, 2:20 would be a dream race for in 26 days. We\'ve already had a few donations, for which I\'m hugely grateful. But I\'m not sure I can grant the wish of a Mark Hughes, who donated $100 to the cause. \"I\'ll donate $1,000 if Peter King chugs a beer at every mile,\'\' Mark wrote. Perhaps another time. \"I think it\'s cool because you\'ll be the unique Dad.\'\' -- Channing Miller, the 8-year-old daughter of Jacksonville scout Marty Miller, reacting to the news that her dad had Parkinson\'s Disease, in a story by Ryan Robinson on Jaguars.com. Miller, 43, was diagnosed with Parkinson\'s in 2009 but continues to work at finding players. Miller, the son of long-time NFL personnel man Les Miller, comes off as a good scout and a better man. He told Robinson he would let GM Gene Smith know when he is becoming a detriment to the organization, which seems to be far off: In 2011, his 10th season as a scout, he wrote more player reports than during any other year of his scouting career. \"My knee just isn\'t the same anymore. It\'s never going to be the same.\"-- Chicago linebacker Brian Urlacher, to FOX Chicago, about the status of his balky left knee, which he injured late last season, re-aggravated early in camp, and had surgery on Aug. 12. He swore that he\'d play in the season opener against Indianapolis. \"I was hoping it would have been just an all-out college party. It would have been worth it. I would have been there all night. I would have gotten hammered. I\'m not kidding.\" -- Patriots All-Pro tight end Rob Gronkowski, in the illuminating story by Chris Ballard in the Sports Illustrated NFL preview issue (shameless plug here). Now, that\'s going to make Gronkowski sound like a stupid party animal, but read the story. On the day The Gronk went out to a paid appearance at a 21-year-old woman\'s birthday party, he was limoed home to his condo near Gillette Stadium, and, on a prime Saturday night in the offseason, went to work out for two hours and then, apparently, straight to bed. The Patriots may have read the story and rolled their eyes at Gronkowski chugging beers and playing beer pong with total strangers for money, but I wouldn\'t worry about it too much if I were Bill Belichick. Gronkowski\'s 23. He\'s living the dream. He realizes where his bread\'s buttered. And I doubt he\'s going to mess that up. \"The first pass I threw in Denver was to Helton. I did not want people seeing me. It becomes a private, sensitive deal. It was not good. He actually thought I was joking when I threw it to him. The ball nose-dived. He was like, \'That\'s funny.\' I was like, \'You don\'t understand.\' \'\' -- Denver quarterback Peyton Manning, in New York Times NFL writer Judy Battista\'s strong Sunday story about the return of Manning. Manning was referring to the summer of the lockout, when his shoulder and neck hurt, and he couldn\'t throw the ball well, and he had no one to confide in about the weakness of his arm, and so he went to Denver to visit good friend and former Tennessee football teammate Todd Helton, the first baseman on the Rockies. They threw privately, and you can understand why Manning was throwing privately: He didn\'t want anyone to see what a disaster his right arm had become. Now, of course, Manning is throwing the ball nearly as well as he did before he got hurt. (I didn\'t say nearly as well as he did in 2000, but nearly as well as he did three years ago.) One other thing: I like that Manning told Battista, a respected national writer for a top newspaper, a very good nugget like that. He realizes that when the New York Times comes to town to write about you, you shouldn\'t just rehash the same stuff you\'ve been saying for six weeks. That\'s a good thing. \"You have to blow me away. You called me.\" -- Miami general manager Jeff Ireland, on his cell phone after hearing from the Indianapolis Colts, who were interested in cornerback Vontae Davis, on HBO\'s Hard Knocks last week. Then Colts GM Ryan Grigson proceeded to blow him away, giving Ireland a firm second-round pick and a conditional sixth-rounder in the 2013 draft for the underachieving but talented 24-year-old Davis. \"I never coached a smarter player. He goes down as one of the great all-time Eagles.\'\' -- Philadelphia coach Andy Reid, at the retirement-as-an-Eagle celebration of Brian Westbrook Wednesday in Philadelphia. I don\'t think I\'ve ever heard of a team that had such a major roster turnover from one year to the next as the Rams from 2011 to 2012. • Exactly 60.4 percent of the roster is new: 32 of 53 men. • Exactly 60.4 percent of the roster is comprised of first-, second- or third-year players. • That means of the Rams\' 53-man opening day 2011 roster, 20 players are still on the team this morning ... while 24 are out of the league. (The 21st Ram on the roster both years wasn\'t on the roster opening day last year -- Justin Cole, a linebacker signed from the Chiefs\' practice squad in November.) So apparently a very young team in 2011 was not very young and talented if one year later, 45 percent of the men on the opening day roster aren\'t in football a year later. GM Les Snead and coach Jeff Fisher will have one honeymoon season and another season where progress must come quickly. And then Missourians will want results, and they\'ll want them now. More a slice of New York life than a true travel note, mostly because I didn\'t travel over the long holiday weekend: I was walking in Manhattan on Friday afternoon, approaching the corner of Park Avenue and East 54th. A young family, apparently, with a 35ish couple and a boy and a girl (I\'m guessing the girl was 9 and the boy 5 or 6, and it was their mom and dad with them) climbed into their Range Rover after loading a few bags in the trunk. Going somewhere for the weekend, I guessed. Before the left rear passenger door was closed, and just as I passed within a few feet of the vehicle, the boy climbed into his backless car booster seat and said to his mom: \"Can I have my phone?\'\' I did a near-double-take. A phone for a 5- or 6-year-old? And the mom pulled out what appeared to be an iPhone or an Android phone, with a rectangular screen, and handed it to the boy. Not to show that I\'m in the prime of my hey-kid-get-off-my-lawn life, but do 6-year-old kids have iPhones in America? It can\'t be. \"The Arizona-Toledo game featured no huddles and a remarkable 182 plays. Only once was the qb under center.\'\' -- @Thebaumerphx, Associated Press sports reporter Robert Baum, after covering a college game in Tucson Saturday night. \"Don\'t feel bad, my black a-- messed up, I made the bed now I gotta lay n it.\'\' -- @ochocinco, former NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson, responding to a sympathetic tweet over him getting cut after having a domestic dispute with his wife. That\'s ... so mature. \"Something that just struck me: If the Saints go 16-0 this season, who wins coach of the year? Joe Vitt? Aaron Kromer? Both?\'\' -- @JeffDuncanTP, New Orleans Times-Picayune columnist Jeff Duncan. Vexing question, one I\'m sure the franchise would love to have answered. \"Thanks for relighting the shortman torch @DangeRussWilson congrats & best of luck this season\'\' -- @DougFlutie, and you\'ve got to believe Russell Wilson loved that. In fact, Wilson re-tweeted it. \"Forget 40 lashes for the guy who came up with idea of 9 p.m. cutdown deadline. Boil the [expletive] in oil.\" -- @pdomo, long-time Philadelphia football writer Paul Domowitch, covering the Friday night cuts on deadline, tweeting at 8:51 p.m. 1. I think I\'ll let you digest a few notes about my preseason predictions: a. Picked the Packers to beat the Broncos (with three road playoff wins to get there) in the Super Bowl, 33-30. b. I know, I know. Peyton Manning has his arm attached by a single tendon and he\'s one hit from never throwing anything but a crust of bread to a robin again. But go back and see how he threw it against San Francisco eight days ago and tell me his arm stinks. And I realize he\'s never been a January road warrior. But here\'s the point about picking Super Bowl champs, as I note in SI\'s preview issue: In the last 15 seasons, 10 teams have leaped from .500 or below one year to the Super Bowl the next. If you\'re going to pick the teams that seem most logical in August, you\'ll not get many Super Bowl matchups right. You\'re not getting many Super Bowl matchups right no matter what method you use, but I\'m not much for picking two chalk teams. c. And about Manning being my MVP and Comeback Player of the Year? Well, if the Broncos do what I say they\'re going to do ... duh. d. I picked four new division champs (Chiefs, Bears, Falcons, Cowboys), and if history tells us anything, I wasn\'t outrageous enough. Not nearly. e. Every year there\'s a last-to-first story. The Chiefs are mine, though it\'s a flimsy last to first, seeing as how they were a game out of first in the AFC West last year. f. As for the Cowboys over the Giants and Eagles in the NFC East, two reasons: Brandon Carr, Morris Claiborne. g. As far as Brooks Reed being my Defensive Player of the Year: Connor Barwin and Reed, as the outside pass rushers in Wade Phillips\' opportunistic 3-4, are going to meet at the quarterback early and often this season. Having J.J. Watt playing in front of him and Brian Cushing alongside him makes Reed (2.5 sacks in the playoff loss at Baltimore) a good candidate for a breakout season. (He said hopefully.) h. How could I pick the Pack to lose five games if I like them so much? Tough slate. Open with two games as physical as they come (Niners then Bears on a short week), Drew Brees in Week 4, at Houston on a Sunday night in Week 6, at Detroit and the Giants back to back in November, Detroit and Chicago back to back in December. i. Toughest five days in football, 2012: Seattle, with the Patriots at home Oct. 14, and at the Niners the following Thursday. j. I did manage to please Cosmo Kramer in the preview issue. \"O.K.,\'\' I wrote in the Super Bowl prediction story, \"I\'ve been seduced by the Peyton Manning kevorka.\'\' Joe Philbin\'s got Costanza, I\'ve got Kramer. k. I overlooked Chandler Jones and Quinton Coples and Whitney Mercilus and Morris Claiborne and Andre Branch to pick Bruce Irvin of Seattle as my Defensive Rookie of the Year. I hate being Mr. Obvious, but after watching Andrew Luck be more precocious in his rookie preseason than Peyton Manning was in his, it was hard to give the Offensive Rookie of the Year to anyone else. 2. I think this is my reaction to Allen Pinkett\'s moronic good-teams-need-criminals point last week, concerning Notre Dame being better off when it fields more guys who get in trouble on and off the field: Last season, the world champion Giants had zero players arrested. And the team New York met in the Super Bowl, the Patriots, had one -- Julian Edelman, for improper touching of a woman, a charge that was dismissed five weeks later. What a bunch of criminals on the two best teams in the football universe. What was that you were saying again, Allen? 3. I think Bill Belichick put it well Sunday when asked about the difficulty of letting veterans he likes and trusts go. So I\'ll just let him speak: \"It\'s the hardest part of the job. It\'s the hardest part of the job to take players that have played for you, won for you and players that have been with us since the spring, the whole offseason, done everything we asked them to do, worked hard, sweated, been banged up, kept going out there, kept playing, kept trying to do everything they could to make the team, to do what we asked them to do, to do it in a team-first attitude and fashion ... and to tell those players that they can\'t be a part of the team is very difficult. \"On the other hand, we all know when we get into this business that that\'s the way it\'s going to be. [As former coach] Jerry Glanville [used to say, the NFL stands for] \'Not For Long.\' A lot of coaches, including myself, have been through that. A lot of players have been through that. It\'s a production business. There\'s not too many of us who have been in this game for very long that haven\'t experienced that in some form or fashion. It\'s part of the business. \"It\'s not a great, real happy day as a head coach when you have to give that news to any players. You could exchange the names but you\'re still affecting somebody\'s life and somebody\'s career and basically somebody who has worked hard and given all that they can to try to earn a spot on your team. It\'s disappointing for them and it\'s not fun to deliver that news.\'\' 4. I think here\'s one good reason to never, ever, ever take any kind of surgery lightly: the case of Trent Richardson. Three weeks ago, those in the know totally, absolutely diminished the significance of Richardson having minor arthroscopic knee surgery. Now Richardson is very iffy for the Browns\' opener Sunday, which is 31 days following what ESPN quoted a team source as saying was a \"two-week deal\'\' for recovery. (I am in no way criticizing ESPN for the report, because it was clearly what everyone from the owner to the janitor at the Browns facility thought to be the case.) I was in Detroit for the preseason opener the day after the \'scope to remove some cartilage from Richardson\'s left knee, and no one thought there was a chance this loomed as a big thing. Richardson has yet to practice with the Browns. He was spied on a stationary bike at practice Saturday, not yet ready for the practice field, and coach Pat Shurmur said he was close to being able to practice with the team. Maybe he plays the opener against Philadelphia, maybe he doesn\'t. Moral of the story: When a guy has an arthroscopic procedure, and every report says it\'s absolutely nothing, and the player will be back in two or three weeks, you should say, \"We\'ll see.\'\' 5. I think I read with amusement the other day when wideout Mike Wallace reported to the Steelers that he had no regrets over his long holdout. Oh really? No regrets? You mean other than playing for $2.7 million this year instead of for a long-term deal in the $10 million a year range, risking getting no long-term deal when he let Antonio Brown get the relatively big money from Pittsburgh a month ago? Wallace could -- and probably will -- end up earning in the neighborhood of $8 million a year somewhere, but he probably has two times in his career to strike while the iron\'s hot. This season was one of them, and it still might happen. But one major injury and everything\'s in flux. 6. I think I had a similar reaction to the end of Maurice Jones-Drew\'s holdout on Sunday -- with not a dime of profit in it for Jones-Drew and maybe a huge penalty with the Jags\' ability to fine him heavily if they wish. \"I have no regrets,\'\' said Jones-Drew. That\'s right. Worked out exactly the way he wanted. Missed five-plus weeks with a new coaching staff. Never met the head coach until a week before the opener. Made zero progress toward a new contract. Lost, most likely, his ability to start the first game of the season. A perfect ending! 7. I think I got a kick out of Daniel Thomas, the Miami running back, complaining about his portrayal on Hard Knocks the other day. He told the Miami Herald he was embarrassed because he\'d never gotten in trouble before with the team. But these truths are true: Thomas was late for two team functions, one team flight and one workout. What, Daniel, you didn\'t know your team was going to be on a national program with TV cameras taping everything in sight? And for those who think the Dolphins aren\'t doing themselves any favors by putting scenes of the coach getting angry at players on TV ... hey, you knew it was coming before training camp started. The players can either like it or not, but they\'d better adjust to it if they want to be on the team and don\'t want to be embarrassed. 8. I think if I had to guess who starts opening day for the Redskins at running back, I\'m looking at Mike Shanahan\'s Olandis Gary-ian history, and I see him playing sixth-round rookie Alfred Morris for nearly the entire first half of the third preseason game, and I see Morris rush for 7.6 yards a carry in the game, and I say: I\'d probably go with Morris. 9. I think it\'s a big game and all, but there are 15 more, and if I were Dallas, I\'d err on the side of caution and keep Jason Witten on the sidelines for another 11 days. 10. I think these are my non-pro football thoughts of the week: a. I don\'t know Bill O\'Brien, but I have very high regard for him. I feel for him. However, he\'s going to end up with an ulcer, or worse, if he takes what will be a long string of losses as hard as he took his first. b. Not saying Oregon\'s helmets lead the nation in weirdness or anything, but there aren\'t any mirrors left in Eugene. c. First six games of West Coast Trip For What Used To Be The Red Sox: Opponents six wins, Sox none. Opponents 54 runs, Sox 15. d. I don\'t blame Bobby Valentine (much), and I don\'t know who could have managed this menagerie. But after the Alfredo Aceves nonsense Saturday night in Oakland, how does Bobby V hang on? e. The Padres and Red Sox have the same (62-73) record. f. The A\'s and Yankees have the same (76-57) record. g. Phil Hughes must drive the Yankees nuts. h. AGone! A walkoff! i. Pitt loses to Youngstown State at home by 14 and Maryland beats William & Mary 7-6 in College Park and Penn State loses to Ohio by 10 at home and Syracuse loses to Northwestern, which built a 22-point lead at Syracuse and won by a point. Sounds like a heck of a year for those Eastern (and I\'m borrowing Maryland here) powers. j. Could we please not have another labor stoppage in hockey? Please? The game\'s too good. I don\'t want to miss a season, or even part of one. k. I had some family in for a visit over the weekend and we rewatched much of the first season of Veep. Must say it was better the second time around. Great, great characters. l. Overall, I liked The Newsroom, but among its flaws was the maddening and constant shoving \"relationships\'\' down our throats. I mean, tell me one news network at which one of the lowest-level producer types -- during a break in the newscast on election night -- would hustle over to the anchor and tell the most important person at the network that he shouldn\'t be bringing all his girlfriends into the newsroom to show off to his former girlfriend. It\'s like some 25-year-old kid one level up from the intern at NBC telling Brian Williams on election night, between reports from the Romney and Obama camps, about how he should handle his love life. The absurdity is absurd times 12. m. Coffeenerdness: Great coffee order at Starbucks in midtown Manhattan the other day. \"Six shots of espresso in a grande cup, with a couple of pumps of hazelnut.\'\' That\'s one tired sugar-monger. n. Beernerdness: Have to hand it to the Yankees, having Goose Island IPA at the downstairs bar behind home plate. Very, very nice. o. Good luck at Penn State this year, Emily Kaplan ... and at Marquette, Tess Quinlan. And please, don\'t be in too much of a hurry to graduate. I still like my job.

Following football\'s shutdown due to the coronavirus crisis, League Two clubs have already voted to end their season early while League One is set to be decided on unweighted points-per-game. In a stark warning on the worrying situation in the lower leagues, Damian Collins MP, the former Chair of the Commons Select Committee, has warned that up to 10 clubs could go into administration within weeks. Endorsing that warning, Neville, a co-owner of League Two Salford, told The Football Show: \"I said some months ago that unless some funds are put in place then we would start to see severe things happen at some clubs.\" League One table League Two table However, Neville clarified: \"My understanding is that clubs will be ok up until June 30. The real problem will come where clubs rely on season-ticket sales for next season. The real issue will come in July, August and September if this coronavirus crisis persists. The clubs will really suffer at his point. I don\'t believe it is a crisis for today, I believe it will come in a few months rather than a few weeks.\" Join the debate Comment below to the join the debate, but please respect our House Rules. If you wish to report any comment, simply click on the down arrow next to the offending comment and click \'Report\' But Neville remains adamant that it is the Premier League rather than the government which should source any rescue deals. \"I\'ve always called on the Premier League to solve the crisis in lower leagues. l wouldn\'t call on the government to do that. I don\'t believe it\'s the government\'s responsibility to save football clubs. The government has far more pressing industries to focus on where millions of jobs are at risk. \"But if the Premier League aren\'t going to perform and do what l believe is their duty, and the government is happy to do some type of loan-based system, then I would support it in a hesitant manner. If that is the only solution l would take it because l don\'t want to see clubs going bust. \"I do believe the Premier League has the ability to do this. Football can sort itself out.\" Neville: \'Salary cap could be biggest game-changer in 40 years\' Neville also had his say on suggestions that a salary cap could be introduced. \"I think there\'s a major issue for players developing in terms of the reset in the game,\" Neville said. Also See: MP warns: \'Ten clubs could go bust\' EFL talks: Stevenage face relegation League One table League Two table \"There are salary cap discussions going on behind the scenes - that\'s been reported - but it\'s going to be the biggest game-changer for lower-league players in the last 30, 40 years. No matter what club you are, what crowd or income you have, you\'ll be restricted to a level you can spend. \"The PFA, I think, are sleepwalking at this moment in time. There is a major reset coming in players\' wages at League One and League Two level - and maybe even Championship if it extends there, as I think it may do at some point in the future. Can you argue against it with clubs going bust and in terms of what is happening with the crisis? You can\'t when you look at it from a sustainability point of view but clubs who want to invest will be prohibited to do so.\" But is that Neville speaking again? 1:05 Hearing double?

That is the view of former Chair of the Commons Select Committee, Damian Collins MP, and the co-owner of League One Sunderland, Charlie Methven. In an interview with Sky Sports News, Collins said the parlous financial state of many League One and Two clubs even before the coronavirus crisis was worrying, but the impact of the pandemic was making the plight of clubs more acute. Collins has called on the Government to provide a financial bailout package, otherwise by next month many clubs will have to file for administration and, if no support is forthcoming, they could cease to exist.

EFL talks: L1 play-off plan, Stevenage face relegation Sunderland: End L1 on pitch, not in court Decisions on Championship, League One fates delayed He said: \"In the next few weeks we could see five to 10 EFL League clubs going into administration. \"We saw the outcry last summer when two clubs, Bury and Bolton were in trouble. If that happens there will be huge public demand to do something, without Government stepping in, those clubs could go to the wall and there may be others that follow. \"Yes it be would be nice if football could help itself, but it won\'t be able to do it. \"I don\'t think there is a body able to stump up the cash needed… it requires leadership from the government here. They need to offer a stake in the clubs, as it\'s a community asset. Those stakes could be bought by Trusts and local authorities.\" EFL chairman Rick Parry has previously indicated that clubs face a \"£200m financial hole\" by September Collins and Methven have drafted a six-point plan to \"rescue football and protect community assets for future generations to enjoy\". In their open letter, the six-point plan advocates... A \'Football Finance Authority\' (FFA) scheme should be created by the Football Association - but working with and backed financially by the government - to provide financial assistance to EFL clubs. Funds should be provided by the FFA to allow clubs to meet their short-term liabilities and provide them enough breathing space to restructure their finances, but couldn\'t be used to invest in recruiting new players or improving the club\'s infrastructure. Rather than being offered as loans, these funds would instead be exchanged for a minority shareholding in the club, of between 10 per cent to 49 per cent, depending on the level of investment required and the value of the club. Independent directors would be appointed to the boards of clubs as representatives for this minority shareholding. These directors can be nominated by either a registered Supporters Trust or by the relevant local government authority, but they must be non-political and subject to approval as \'Fit and Proper\' by the FFA. These Independent Directors shall have real-time access to the financial records of their club and can report their concerns back to the FFA. Clubs that continue to trade outside the rules of the EFL would be put into a form of administration by the FFA, where a credible plan would be implemented by independent auditors to bring the financial affairs of the club back in line with the League\'s rules. Either a recognised Supporters Trust or a local authority can subsequently acquire the FFA shareholding in their club at a discount to market value, and funds raised in this way would be returned to the government to help repay the public investment in this scheme. The EFL\'s financial regulations should be set and enforced by the FFA, the governing body of which should include representation from the EFL, the Professional Footballers Association (PFA), the Football Supporters Association (FSA) and the clubs themselves, but with an independent majority. 3:42 Sky Sports News reporter Ben Ransom says the English Football League has provided its clubs with a \'clear pathway\' to curtail the 2019-20 season Sky Sports News reporter Ben Ransom says the English Football League has provided its clubs with a \'clear pathway\' to curtail the 2019-20 season Collins warned that a Government bailout, in effect taxpayers\' money, must come with a six-point \'strings attached\' plan, otherwise, within months the clubs would continue to be run so badly they will be coming back needing more. Money must not be used to buy players, it\'s sole function must be used for financial sustainability. EFL Chair Rick Parry told a Commons Select Committee earlier this month that the EFL would face a \'black hole of £200m\' by September and the former Chair of that Committee said that figure was \"not fantastical\" although he doubted whether any Government would provide a bailout amounting to that figure. It is understood that the EFL and its clubs have been discussing for some time about ways to reform financial rules and that those positive discussions remain ongoing. Government wants grassroots football back \'as soon as safely can\' Coronavirus in Sport latest Championship players given self-test option Following the release of this open letter, a Government DCMS spokesperson told Sky Sports News: \"We are in regular, ongoing discussions with the EFL and other football authorities on the impact of coronavirus, how the professional game can safely return and how the wider football family can be supported.\" Earlier this month Secretary of State for Culture, Media & Sport Oliver Dowden announced a £16m package to help Rugby League through its financial problems. 0:44 PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor says the steps being taken towards the resumption of football are \'encouraging\', but warns they must be cautious in their approach PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor says the steps being taken towards the resumption of football are \'encouraging\', but warns they must be cautious in their approach Their six-point plan has received backing from the former Football Association Chair Baron David Triesman. He said: \"Damian Collins and Charlie Methven have clearly devoted considerable thought to the financial and social crises facing football. \"They have identified some very practical routes through to a more secure future and I welcome this wholeheartedly. It is a pity that football so seldom does the work needed itself. \"But it doesn\'t. This is therefore an especially important intervention.\" Malcolm Clarke, chair of the Football Supporters\' Association and supporter representative on the FA Council also added his support: \"The necessary restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have made government support for football clubs - a vital part of our communities and culture - an urgent necessity. \"We welcome the call for that assistance to be both prompt and linked to future sustainability. \"Football now has a unique opportunity to reset and adopt new ideas, which not only secure the short-term future of clubs, but help them thrive in the seasons ahead.

There have been disagreements between the League One clubs over how to continue the campaign and, any decision to curtail the season, will only take place if the clubs vote in favour of doing so. League Two clubs have already voted to end their season early, pending approval from the EFL and the FA. League One table League Two table League Two clubs agreed that three teams should be promoted to League One, the promotion play-offs should still take place and no teams should be relegated to the National League - but the EFL has now said that relegation across all three divisions of the EFL is \"integral\" to the integrity of the competition.

As well as setting out the principle on relegation, the EFL board says the play-offs should be played in the event of curtailment but should not be extended beyond the regular four teams. It also says that the decision to curtail in each division should require a 51 per cent majority among the clubs concerned, with League One sides in open disagreement about whether to stop or play on. EFL chairman Rick Parry said: \"In the event that a divisional decision is made to curtail the 2019-20 season, the EFL board is recommending that the league adopts the original framework with the amendments as identified, as there is a strong desire to remain as faithful as possible to the regulations and ensure there is consistency in the approach adopted across the EFL in all divisions. \"The board has always acknowledged that a single solution to satisfy all clubs would always be hard to find, but we are at the point now where strong, definitive action is needed for the good of the league and its members.\" \'Devastatingly harsh\' - Tranmere vice-chairman Tranmere currently sit 21st in League One and have a game in hand over AFC Wimbledon who are three points above in 20th. As it stands, Tranmere would be relegated on points-per-game along with Southend and Bolton - a scenario Tranmere vice-chairman Nicola Palios does not believe is fair. It would be devastatingly harsh for @TranmereRovers to be relegated on PPG when it is such a marginal call. We have a game in hand and are 3 points behind. We were on a great run of form (WWW) having made the investment in Jan to ensure our safety - and it was working. #TRFC — Nicola Palios (@NicolaPalios) May 21, 2020 \"It would be devastatingly harsh for Tranmere Rovers to be relegated on PPG when it is such a marginal call,\" she said on Twitter. \"We have a game in hand and are 3 points behind. We were on a great run of form (WWW) having made the investment in Jan to ensure our safety - and it was working. \"How can it be fair that we are robbed of a chance to keep our place in L1, but other clubs are given a chance to take it?\" MP says EFL League One, League Two clubs could fold without Government bailout An urgent and substantial Government bailout is needed for clubs in the EFL Leagues One and Two, otherwise, up to 10 clubs could go into administration within weeks. That is the view of former Chair of the Commons Select Committee, Damian Collins MP, and the co-owner of League One Sunderland, Charlie Methven. He said: \"In the next few weeks we could see five to 10 EFL League clubs going into administration.\" \'We have earned the right to go up\' Fleetwood boss Barton wants to finish the League One season Fleetwood Town manager Joey Barton on The Football Show \"I want to finish the season for the integrity of the competition - it is the only fair way,\" he said. \"That is the easy thing to do (to vote to finish the season on a points-per-game system), it is the safety. \"But we think that… last season we were 11th and never in this picture, what would we have done in that scenario? We would have tried to play on and I do not know if that is right or wrong, but that is just the ethos of our club, our chairman Andy Pilley wants to do that. Our players want to do that, mainly because we think we can get automatic. \"We are in a great vein of form, the team is growing bit by bit, we have been to some of the toughest places in our division and got the right results and our lads are chomping at the bit to play on. \"We are a bit gutted that it will go to a play-off system, but also we are lucky that we still get a chance to play for our own future and it is in our own hands. And for most of our lads it could be the last-chance scenario to play in the Championship. \"We do not have the budget of some of these big clubs, Ipswich and Sunderland, our budget is £3m and theirs is £12m, 13m, £14m, £15m. And normally, we would not have a chance, so we are right in the mix this year and it is right that we get the chance to attempt to go up because we have earned it.\" \'There is no way I wanted to stop the season\' Ainsworth thinks his side can still finish in the top two of League One this season Wycombe Wanderers manager Gareth Ainsworth on The Football Show \"We still think we had a good chance on the pitch of getting one of the automatics,\"he said. \" I watched Joey [Barton] earlier and my sentiments are the same as him. We have 10 games to go, we have seven in the bottom half of the table, we have been in the top two more than any other club this season - 20 weeks in total. \"And the only reason we dropped out that top three is we had Bury scheduled the week before the lockdown. So everyone has passed us, we were ready to play Burton the next Saturday and everything gets called off. Rightly so, by the way, I am not saying it should not be. \"So we still had plenty to play for on the pitch and again, Joey and Gary [Neville] alluded to it this morning - cost and finances are now a huge issue for clubs playing on. My own are included. \"So from a competitive point of view, give me the 10 games we have remaining because I believe we will finish at least in the playoffs, if not an automatic. But it has to be safe, everyone has to be safe before we come back.

It is just not the right thing to do. So obviously I\'m happy with the points per game because we do end up in the playoffs, but believe me, there is no way I wanted to stop the season. We were back in form, had some good players back to fitness and looking forward to challenging for these top two spots.\" For more on this story, click here Super 6: Dortmund to keep heat on Bayern?

I’m a wolves supporter and today is wolves vs watford. The app said wolves were playing a 343 formation when it was actually 3421. Another time with El-Classico, the app said Real Madrid we’re playing a 433 and it said Isco was in LW. Even when the match started they didn’t bother to change it. It makes you look like an idiot in front of your friends. I showed my friends the el Classico formations on goal and they thought I was joking. It’s called ‘Goal’ for a reason, it’s best known for getting goals early. LongTimeUserDylan , 05/02/2018 App went downhill Goal used to be a great app. I have used goal for news and scores for probably 8 years at least and its gotten to the point where I hate to use it anymore. For starters, the AD’s are incredibly intrusive. Its one thing for AD’s to just be everywhere but goal forces them upon you and anytime you open the app or a story AD’s constantly pop up in your face and you cant even use the app until time has expired. I cant even remember one AD because I get so mad when it pops up I refuse to look at it. Additionally media does not work on the iphone app. I have never been able to open a story with a video and watch it on the iphone app. Multimedia on iphone apps is pretty norm so it shouldnt be hard to deliver videos to a mobile iphone app. Eliozo , 09/22/2019 App in general In my opinion, this is the best application to use for football news and live scores. If you know how to use it, this app can be wonderful. Just turn on notifications and set some teams/leagues you like in your favorites. You sometimes get live scores notifications before happening on tv, you can tell it’s a goal and flex on your friends without them knowing. Talking about football news, they send notifications of the latest rumors and news about your favorite clubs.

Broadcasting, matchday and retail, revenue are down by more than £30million in the first three months of 2020, according to the results released on Thursday which show that United\'s net debt has shot up by £127.4m to £429.1m. United have withdrawn their previous revenue forecast of between £560-£580m for the year \'given ongoing uncertainty due to COVID-19 and the evolving related economic and financial consequences\'.

Share this article Share 2k shares United\'s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward warned that the results for the next two quarters could be even worse. \'Our third quarter results published today reflect a partial impact that the pandemic has had on the club, while the greater impact will be in the current quarter and likely beyond,\' said Woodward. Broadcasting revenue was down more than 50 per cent on the previous quarter, a decrease of £27.7m. This is largely based on United\'s estimate that they will have to pay back £20m to Sky Sports, BT Sports and international broadcasters because their remaining games will be played behind closed doors – with £15m of that total accounted for in this quarter. Matchday revenue was down by £2.6m due to United\'s remaining home games in the Premier League and Europa League being postponed. Retail revenue also dropped by £1.1m due to the closure of the club\'s megastore, although there was still a small increase in both commercial (£2m) and sponsorship revenue (£3.1m). United\'s gross debt has not changed but the net debt (calculated as gross debt minus cash reserves) has risen significantly. This is because the club\'s cash balance has dropped to £90.3m, in part due to paying Leicester City £80m up front for Harry Maguire and the first instalment on Bruno Fernandes\'s £46.6m initial fee from Sporting Lisbon. However, United remain in better financial health than their rivals and still have access to a further £150m credit facility. Finances will take another hit with any more games this season played behind closed doors United owners Avram Glazer (left) and Joel Glazer will take a heavy hit amid the Covid-19 crisis Despite the worrying financial outlook, Woodward insisted that it takes second place to the more wide-ranging impact of the pandemic. \'Our focus remains on the health and well-being of our colleagues, fans and partners around the world and we are extremely proud of how those connected to the club have responded during this crisis,\' he added. \'Since the start of the pandemic, Manchester United and our Foundation have provided assistance to hospitals, charities and schools in our communities, as well as support for frontline workers and vulnerable fans. \'These actions reflect our core values as a club and the resilience through adversity that we have demonstrated many times throughout our long history and will do so again to weather these current challenges. \'In that spirit, we look forward to the team safely returning to the pitch and building on the exciting momentum that Ole and the players had previously achieved, while taking all necessary steps to protect public health. Our thoughts remain with all those affected during this unprecedented time.\' United\'s financial statement on Thursday further explained how the club have reacted to the worldwide crisis. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\'s team had played themselves into good form when the season stopped It read: \'Manchester United has taken a range of measures to support its communities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including donations to food banks and outreach to elderly and disabled supporters. \'In addition, the Manchester United Foundation has committed over £1M to community initiatives, including the supply of 60,000 meals for health workers in local hospitals and support for schools and vulnerable children across Greater Manchester. \'The Club has also used its media platforms to deliver public health messages and to support frontline workers around the world. \'Operationally, the impact of the pandemic and measures to prevent further spread continues to disrupt its businesses in a number of ways, most significantly in Broadcasting and Matchday operations. \'Old Trafford and its flagship Megastore operations have been closed to visitors since 20 March 2020 and Museum, Stadium Tour and Red Café operations have been closed since 17 March 2020. \'Government imposed restrictions have also resulted in the postponement of the Premier League, UEFA competitions and FA Cup competition since 13 March 2020. \'Postponement of the Premier League and changes to match scheduling has resulted in a reduction in the total broadcasting revenue expected for the season and has impacted broadcasting revenue during the quarter for matches played to date. \'In addition, during the quarter, Broadcasting and Matchday revenues were impacted due to the postponement of three matches: one away Premier League match, one home Round of 16 Europa League match and one away FA Cup quarter-final match.\' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next \'He was brutal with me\': Gary Neville reveals how Peter... \'I\'d rather have a hole in the squad than an a***hole\': Ole... \'It\'s only the first day, but it\'s been a good start\':...

Following the latest EFL board meeting, League One is set to be decided on unweighted points-per-game with play-offs then expected to decide who is promoted alongside the top two teams. EFL talks: L1 play-off plan, Stevenage face relegation Gayr Neville: Premier League should save EFL clubs MP: Government bailout needed to save some L1 & L2 clubs The League One teams have been in open disagreement about how to finish the campaign, with Barton and Fleetwood wanting a full conclusion to the season, but the manager understands why some may not want to risk the future of their clubs. Speaking on The Football Show, Barton said: \"I\'d prefer to finish the campaign, we\'ve been quite vocal about that from the start. We believe we could have got [one of] the [automatic promotion places], I think we\'d had one defeat in 17, unbeaten in 12 and been away to every side who had a chance of winning the league. \"We had to play nine games, six of those were in the bottom 10, three of those six were in the bottom three - you\'d argue Bolton and Southend were already down and probably only Tranmere fighting for survival there - so we felt like we had a shot at the automatics, we were two points behind Rotherham with them to play at home. The top half of the Sky Bet League One table as it stands... ... And how the top half of the table would look if the standings were calculated on unweighted points per game \"We\'re disappointed in this but we will get a chance with a play-off situation and I do feel sorry for Sunderland - I never thought I\'d say that - but I do feel sorry for them, I feel a bit aggrieved for Gillingham, Doncaster and even Ipswich probably because they all would have had a legitimate shot at a play-off place. Peterborough, who are a very good side, it looks like if they do a points system they will miss out [along with Sunderland] and Wycombe will jump in with Oxford, Portsmouth and ourselves. \"I think there are a lot of factors [surrounding teams not wanting to play the rest of the season]. They don\'t have much ambition to play on because they don\'t have much to play for and that\'s understandable. League One table League Two table Live: The Football Show May 25, 2020, 9:00am Live on Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \"They\'ve got no crowds in, which is a huge part of the revenue streams for those types of clubs. They\'ve obviously now got a government-backed furlough scheme where they can recoup a percentage of the salaries while the crowds aren\'t in and the likes of Accrington and Rochdale, they\'ve seen Bury go out of business last year, Bolton almost went out of business too, and you can understand them wanting to protect their football clubs because of the impact those clubs have on the local community. \"I\'m not here to tell anybody they should do one thing or another, but I would say is you start the season with the aim of playing the 46 games and I think you should adhere to that.... If we\'re not careful, we might not have football clubs to come back to so we\'ve got to find the balance between what is right for everybody, but also what is right for the integrity of the competition and I think it\'s important to finish the competition if we start it. Joey Barton says he understands why some clubs would not want to play the remainder of the season \"Hopefully we do that and there are going to be winners and losers in this. I think Tranmere will be aggrieved going into League Two next season, Sunderland, Peterborough and a few other sides will be aggrieved and the winners will probably be Wycombe in that scenario, getting in [to the play-off places] and Rotherham have won the lottery getting second because I think they had six of the top 10 to play in the last period. \"So it\'s not fair for a lot of sides but on the other side, this is a global pandemic and we have to resolve it one way or another for the sanctimony of the competition.\" Ainsworth: We still had plenty to play for 1:09 Damian Collins MP says up to 10 Football League clubs could go into administration as a result of losing their matchday revenue Damian Collins MP says up to 10 Football League clubs could go into administration as a result of losing their matchday revenue Wycombe Wanderers would jump five places up the League One table if points-per-game is implemented, but manager Gareth Ainsworth echoed Barton\'s thoughts and would like to finish the full complement of remaining games. Also appearing on The Football Show, he said: \"We still think we had a good chance on the pitch of getting one of the automatics. I watched Joey earlier and my sentiments are the same as him. We have 10 games to go, we have seven in the bottom half of the table, we have been in the top two more than any other club this season - 20 weeks in total. \"And the only reason we dropped out that top three is we had Bury scheduled the week before the lockdown. So everyone has passed us, we were ready to play Burton the next Saturday and everything gets called off. Rightly so, by the way, I am not saying it should not be. Gareth Ainsworth agreed with Joey Barton and Gary Neville on The Football Show \"So we still had plenty to play for on the pitch and again, Joey and Gary (Neville) alluded to it this morning - cost and finances are now a huge issue for clubs playing on. My own are included. \"So from a competitive point of view, give me the 10 games we have remaining because I believe we will finish at least in the playoffs, if not an automatic. But it has to be safe, everyone has to be safe before we come back. \"And we cannot be putting clubs out of business as has been alluded to as well. It is just not the right thing to do. So obviously I\'m happy with the points per game because we do end up in the playoffs, but believe me, there is no way I wanted to stop the season. We were back in form, had some good players back to fitness and looking forward to challenging for these top two spots.\" Carra: Teams must come together 3:42 Sky Sports News reporter Ben Ransom says the English Football League has provided its clubs with a \'clear pathway\' to curtail the 2019-20 season Sky Sports News reporter Ben Ransom says the English Football League has provided its clubs with a \'clear pathway\' to curtail the 2019-20 season Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher called for unity among clubs as the argument rages on over how to finish the current campaigns and dismissed the idea the Championship could break away from the EFL. \"I do not think this is a time for leagues leaving each other and splitting up. This is a time, if possible, to try and come together,\" he said. \"We have talked so much about self interest in deciding matters and of course there is self interest in every league up and down this country in terms of what leagues should do: should they stop now, points per game, carry on. Everyone has their own self interest. \"But in terms of football clubs financially and keeping clubs going, everyone should come together and help each other, so I would not like to see the Championship move away and make a Premier League 2. \"There has been a lot of noise in the past from the owners of Leeds and West Brom trying to align themselves more with the Premier League and that would just be for financial [reasons].

Bayern Munich maintained their four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga with a 2-0 away win at Union Berlin last Sunday, while Borussia Dortmund thrashed rivals Schalke in 4-0 in their local derby. Meanwhile, Wolfsburg moved into the European places at the expense of Schalke thanks to a last-gasp winner at Augsburg. Bundesliga table | Results | Fixtures Bundesliga return: What did we learn? Bundesliga scout report: \'Havertz hype is real\' Bruno Labbadia got off to a winning start as manager of Hertha Berlin in a convincing victory at Hoffenheim, while Werder Bremen\'s woes continued with a 4-1 home defeat to Bayer Leverkusen. As a result, they stay in 17th place, one point above Paderborn at the foot of the table. McInally, a former Bayern striker, gives us his predictions for the weekend\'s games... Wolfsburg 1-3 Borussia Dortmund (12/1 with Sky Bet) It was difficult for Wolfsburg at Augsburg, but Daniel Ginczek got the winner in the end. It was a tight game, but Wolfsburg were always the better team. Renato Steffen got the other goal, so to go and get a result at Augsburg was impressive. Augsburg will not go down, but were in 14th, so Dortmund will be a different proposition. They are in pole position for the last European spot, but Freiburg, Schalke and Hoffenheim are chasing behind. Wolfsburg will be licking their lips with Dortmund coming to town. Dortmund are odds-on, and I would not say for sure that Dortmund will cruise this. Both teams will score. Raphael Guerreiro scored two and was excellent, as was Julian Brandt and Thorgan Hazard. Brandt was probably the player of the weekend for me and impressed massively. Erling Haaland scored once again and he thinks he is going to score every game! Haaland scored Dortmund\'s first against Schalke Marco Reus looks as though he is definitely out for the season and Dan-Axel Zagadou is still out, so Mats Hummels will be at the heart of a back three, with Lukasz Piszczek and Manuel Akanji either side. They looked pretty solid against Schalke, who were not at the races. I think Wolfsburg will have a goal in them, but whether they can cope with the free-flowing pace of Dortmund will be another thing. It was weird to watch with no crowd, but psychologically they have had weeks to deal with the fact there is and will not be any fans. It sounds weird and you can hear their shouts, but the weekend went well. Others may not enjoy it, but if they do not, do they like football in the first place? Super 6: Too hot to handle? Borussia Dortmund can again close the gap at the top to just one point before Bayern play at 5:30pm, with 88 per cent of Super 6 entrants expecting Dortmund to take home the points, despite Wolfsburg sitting inside the top six.

Report: Bayern make winning return Report: Havertz double inspires Leverkusen Alphonso Davies\' incredible rise to the top Bayern Munich 2-0 Frankfurt (8/1 with Sky Bet) Bayern will be delighted to be back at their home ground. Robert Lewandowski got another goal in their win over Union and we are talking about Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi figures in all competitions for him. Bayern have scored 50 goals in their last 16 games, and that is largely down to Lewandowksi. Benjamin Pavard scored the second with a header to seal it. Lewandowski celebrates after putting Bayern ahead at Union from the spot They brushed Union aside in the end, but Manuel Neuer still had to make a couple of saves. Bayern are not rock solid at the back and will give you chances. Neuer has signed a new contract until 2023 and the back line will continue to have one of the best goalkeepers in the world behind them. Frankfurt were very poor against Borussia Monchengladbach. Some of their best results have come against the top six sides, but Bas Dost needs to start scoring - Andre Silva came on to get a goal too. Their form has not been great and that will continue here. Adolf Hutter will juggle the pack. Bayern were pretty good and they know they are being chased, not by Dortmund, but the other three behind them as well. They must get a result before they go to Dortmund on Tuesday in a massive game. No player in Europe\'s top five leagues is close to Robert Lewandowski\'s goal total Super 6: Three\'s a crowd?

Report: Dortmund thrash Schalke Round-up: Leipzig lose ground in title race Enter your Super 6 predictions for a chance to win £50,000 Borussia Monchengladbach 2-1 Bayer Leverkusen (9/1 with Sky Bet) The result at the weekend was a cracker for Monchengladbach. They came out of the traps and put the game to bed early doors. They are sitting in third, two wins behind Bayern. If they can get a result against Leverkusen, it will put them in a great position ahead of Bayern\'s match against Frankfurt. Alassane Plea put Monchengladbach ahead against Frankfurt last weekend That being said, Leverkusen scored four on Monday and I will mention the man in the spotlight. Kai Havertz is only 20 and he is a goal machine, while being a presence in the air. Michael Ballack is pleading with him to stay another year, to make sure he progresses his own game. Gladbach\'s defence is one of the finest in the league, with Matthias Ginter one to look out for. He has been fantastic for them this campaign. It will be difficult for Leverkusen to have things their own way. I would not be surprised if Havertz is on the scoresheet in this one, in what will be one of the games of the weekend. Super 6: Sit on the fence? With just two points and two places in the table separating these sides, it seems even the predictions are to close to call. A healthy 42 per cent of Super 6 players are backing a home win, with 30 per cent hoping for a draw between the two. Who will you side with? Play for free here.

Clubs in the French top flight earned €635 million from player sales in the 2018-19 season (down from €840 million the previous season), and with revenue streams being slashed left, right and centre during the current crisis, it has become an even more precious income source than before. Although it remains to be seen exactly how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect the transfer market, clubs from around Europe will already be sizing up the best talent in Ligue 1. Featuring the thoughts of a former Ligue 1 scout from a major Premier League club, here are seven players who could find themselves in pastures new by the end of the summer. Thomas Meunier, 28, Right-Back, Paris Saint-Germain DeFodi Images/Getty Images If Paris Saint-Germain are able to play their Champions League quarter-final at some point in the coming months, there is no guarantee that Thomas Meunier will be in their starting lineup when they do. A 2016 signing from Club Brugge, the Belgium international will be out of contract at the end of June, and there seems no prospect of his deal being extended. He has failed to convince PSG coach Thomas Tuchel of his worth during the two years that they have worked together, and while Meunier has repeatedly declared that he wants to stay at the Parc des Princes, he is also confident that he will not be short of offers if he does leave. \"A 28-year-old player, who\'s out of contract, who\'s free, who\'s an international in the world\'s number one team [according to the latest FIFA rankings], it can\'t be a bad deal,\" Meunier said during an Instagram Live interview with Belgian broadcaster RTBF in April. \"In terms of the investment, even if I develop gangrene and they have to cut off one of my legs, they won\'t have much money to lose.\" An avowed Anglophile, Meunier grew up supporting Manchester United and has been reading Peter Crouch\'s autobiography during lockdown. He has regularly been linked with a move to the Premier League, and with few international-class right-backs on the market, this summer could be the time for him to finally cross the Channel. The scout\'s view: \"I\'m surprised and not surprised that PSG don\'t want to keep him. Surprised because he\'s 28, he\'s a Belgium international and he\'s been effective in some of their biggest games. But I\'m not surprised because if they want to go to the next level, PSG probably feel they need to have a better player in that position. I think he\'d be a good option for a Premier League club, particularly as he\'s free.\" Victor Osimhen, 21, Striker, Lille Michel Spingler/Associated Press Lille have mastered the art of buying low and selling high—as demonstrated by Nicolas Pepe\'s £72 million transfer to Arsenal last year—and Victor Osimhen looks set to become the latest player to walk that well-trodden path. Signed from Charleroi for a reported fee of €12 million last July, Osimhen burst on to the scene in France with a brace on his debut against Nantes and went on to score 18 goals in all competitions—including strikes against Chelsea and Valencia in the Champions League—before the French season was curtailed. A blisteringly quick and explosive striker, Osimhen has been linked with some of the biggest clubs in Europe and has reportedly been the subject of a £76 million bid from an unnamed suitor, per Telefoot. While Lille president Gerard Lopez vowed on RTL in February (h/t RMC) that \"Osimhen will be a Lille player next season,\" a hefty bid would seriously test the club\'s resolve. The Nigeria international, who grew up in abject poverty in Lagos, has expressed an ambition to play in the Premier League, but at this stage of his career, he is not prepared to sit on the bench. \"My priority is to play a lot of games,\" Osimhen told The Independent last month. \"Signing for a big club and being on the bench is not exciting for me.\" The scout\'s view: \"Osimhen\'s main traits are that he\'s quick and he\'s shown that he can score goals. You can compare him to someone like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Like Aubameyang, he needs to find a team that will suit his way of playing. I think he\'ll have a move because Lille want to sell him and their business plan is based on selling players.\" Axel Disasi, 22, Centre-Back, Reims FRANCK FIFE/Getty Images It does not take too much imagination to picture reported Arsenal target Axel Disasi in the north London club\'s colours—and not only because Reims play in the same red shirts and white sleeves as his potential future employers. Disasi, who turned 22 in March, got his big break at Reims last summer when Bjorn Engels left the club to join Aston Villa. Drafted into central defence alongside the experienced Yunis Abdelhamid, Disasi helped to turn the side from champagne country into the most formidable defensive unit in France, with only 21 goals conceded over the course of the curtailed Ligue 1 campaign. Tall and powerfully built, the dreadlocked Disasi is a front-foot defender who relies on his sense of anticipation to attack the ball in the air and on the ground. Although he has a tendency to dive into tackles, his physicality and authoritative playing style have prompted comparisons with Chelsea\'s Kurt Zouma. Once in possession, he tends to keep things simple, but he is fond of hitting across the ball with his right foot to send long raking passes up the pitch. The France under-20 international has been linked with Arsenal and Monaco and is reportedly being tracked by a number of leading German clubs, per Goal. L\'Equipe reported in April that he will be allowed to leave Reims if the club receive a \"suitable offer.\" The scout\'s view: \"From my point of view, there\'s been a lot of talk about him. He only has one year left on his contract, and Reims want to sell him for as much money as they can. He\'s performed well this season, but I don\'t think he\'s a top centre-back. I have doubts about him.\" Stephane Ruffier, 33, Goalkeeper, Saint-Etienne Jean Catuffe/Getty Images Had the season panned out as Stephane Ruffier would have hoped, he would be closing in on his 400th appearance for Saint-Etienne. But those ambitions hit the skids even before the coronavirus outbreak brought the season to a premature conclusion. With Saint-Etienne struggling towards the bottom of the Ligue 1 table, manager Claude Puel elected to drop Ruffier for a home game against Reims in late February in favour of perennial back-up goalkeeper Jessy Moulin. Ruffier\'s agent, Patrick Glanz, was outraged, accusing Puel in L\'Equipe of \"spitting on a Saint-Etienne legend,\" and matters have scarcely improved since. Puel confirmed recently that Moulin will remain his first-choice goalkeeper next season and indicated that the club would consider offers for Ruffier. \"Stephane still has a year left on his contract, and I\'ll respect his decision,\" Puel told regional newspaper Le Progres. \"If he so wishes, we\'ll look at whichever possibilities present themselves.\" The shaven-headed Ruffier joined Saint-Etienne from 2011 and has made 315 top-flight appearances for the club, which is more than any other goalkeeper in Les Verts\' history. Renowned for his consistency, he possesses spectacular goal-line reflexes, although he does not dominate his penalty area and is not completely at ease with the ball at his feet. Capped three times by France, Ruffier would suit a club looking for some experience and reliability between the posts. The scout\'s view: \"I don\'t see him going to a top club. He\'s not that tall—he\'s only 1.88m (6\'2\"). Most clubs in England, for example, would like a very tall goalkeeper. He\'s already 33, so there\'d be no return on the investment in this kind of player. And I\'m not sure how he would adapt [to a new league]. But he has one of the biggest salaries at Saint-Etienne and he only has one year left on his contract. Saint-Etienne are struggling for money, so they\'re not going to let him go for free [in 2021].\" Ibrahima Diallo, 21, Defensive Midfielder, Brest FRED TANNEAU/Getty Images Ibrahima Diallo is still to play a full campaign of top-level football, but he made a striking impression in his first half-season in Ligue 1 with Brest. France Football magazine picked Diallo to anchor the midfield in its \"Nice Surprises\" team of the season\'s first half and described the former Monaco youth-team player as \"one of the revelations of the start of the season.\" Diallo, who is the younger brother of PSG centre-back Abdou Diallo, is an all-action defensive midfielder who has been likened to N\'Golo Kante. Prior to being sidelined by a hamstring injury at the end of January, he had generally played alongside Haris Belkebla in a midfield two, but he has also been deployed as a solitary holding midfielder in a 4-3-3 formation. Capped by France at under-20 level, according to Brest On Air, Diallo was linked with a move to Leicester City in January and is reportedly being tracked by Everton, Sevilla and Nice, per L\'Equipe. In an interview with Ultimo Diez, he cited the Premier League and the Bundesliga as two leagues he would like to play in, and at Brest, there is an acceptance that he will not be playing at Stade Francis-Le Ble forever. \"He\'s a mature and grounded boy,\" Brest coach Olivier Dall\'Oglio said in March. \"It\'s not surprising that clubs more glamorous than Stade Brestois have been coming to find out about him.\" The scout\'s view: \"There\'s a question mark over him, for me. But let\'s see. He and his brother didn\'t come from the Paris area, so they\'ve not had to fight in the same way. Nampalys Mendy was also compared to N\'Golo Kante when he came from Nice and look what happened there. Could he cope with the standards in the Premier League? Every week is a battle.\" Morgan Sanson, 25, Central Midfielder, Marseille Sylvain Lefevre/Getty Images With Marseille facing financial fair play sanctions from UEFA after racking up cumulative losses of €170 million between 2017 and 2019, they will find it difficult to turn down bids for their star players this summer, even with a Champions League campaign to prepare for. Three-and-a-half years after arriving from Montpellier, midfielder Morgan Sanson is seen as one of the players most likely to help Marseille hit their target of €60 million in incoming transfer fees. A box-to-box midfielder with an excellent first touch, a good engine and an eye for goal, the former France under-21 international was a virtual ever-present in 2019-20 as OM unexpectedly secured a return to the Champions League. \"He\'s a creator,\" Sanson\'s Marseille team-mate Boubacar Kamara told the Ligue 1 website earlier this year. \"He has lots of character and covers lots of ground. It\'s like he has three lungs—he makes runs from the first minute to the last.\" Per L\'Equipe, Sanson has been linked with several Premier League clubs, including Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton and West Ham United, and has reportedly engaged the services of Israeli super-agent Pini Zahavi to help him find a club in England. The scout\'s view: \"Would Morgan Sanson suit the style of play of an English club? I don\'t know. He\'d need a Latin coach—someone like Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. He has good technical abilities, but on a physical level, he might find playing in the Premier League difficult.\" Serhou Guirassy, 24, Striker, Amiens Soccrates Images/Getty Images Like Marseille, Amiens are another club in need of funds, although in their case it is because of their bitterly contested demotion to Ligue 2 following the curtailment of the Ligue 1 season. Having scored nine times in 23 matches, including a coolly taken brace in a 4-4 draw against PSG in February, Serhou Guirassy takes pride of place in the club\'s shop window. Something of an old-fashioned target man, Guirassy is tall and strong and excels with his back to goal, making him a useful out-ball. His ability to shield the ball makes him particularly adept at winning free-kicks, and out of all the forwards who played in Ligue 1 this season, only PSG\'s Neymar and Bordeaux\'s Nicolas de Preville suffered more fouls per 90 game than the Amiens No. 9 (2.7, per WhoScored). Guirassy, who previously spent two-and-a-half years at Cologne, has been linked with Arsenal, Chelsea Tottenham and West Ham, per Metro. He is represented by London-based French agent Moussa Sissoko, whose clients include Barcelona\'s Ousmane Dembele and Rennes starlet Eduardo Camavinga. \"We have an arrangement with Serhou,\" Amiens president Bernard Joannin told L\'Equipe\'s television channel in May. \"He had some really significant offers from English clubs. He wanted to stay in order to save the club—that\'s what he told me. He wanted to finish the story with his team-mates. We have significant offers from England and France.\" The scout\'s view: \"He\'s performed well this season and is physically strong. I think he would do well in England. He could perform for a Premier League club. I think he\'s ready because he\'s already played abroad, at Cologne. He\'ll be more prepared to succeed if he goes to a foreign country again.\" Facebook Logo Twitter Logo Copy Link Icon Related Report: PSG Make $65M Bid for Icardi Inter want $75M, with talks ongoing World Football Report: PSG Make $65M Bid for Icardi Sky Sportsvia Sky Sports Potential Premier League Bargains 💰 👀 B/R names 5 lower league talents 🔍 Expert recommends ideal clubs ⭐️ Who is the next unearthed gem?

In Madrid on May 22, 2010, Mourinho\'s Inter beat Bayern Munich 2-0 to complete a treble - including Serie A and the Coppa Italia - and become only the fifth manager in history to win Europe\'s top club competition with two different clubs. Having already collected two pieces of silverware that season, the Portuguese coach said the deciding factor in beating Bayern was that he was solely focused on how important it was to his players - not to himself. When Inter Milan stunned Barcelona The story of the night Jose Mourinho\'s Inter shocked Pep Guardiola\'s Barcelona in 2010 \"In the final against Bayern Munich, there hasn\'t been a single moment when I thought about myself,\" Mourinho, the current Tottenham Hotspur manager, told Sky Sports News. \"I never thought \'if we win, I will get my hands on my second Champions League\'. I never thought \'if we lift the cup, I will win the FIFA Manager of the year\". I never thought about myself. My mind was always fully focused on bringing joy to others. \"For me it was all about the meaning that the cup had for chairman Massimo Moratti, for club captain and legend Javier Zanetti, for all the players, for the fans. For me it was all about being unselfish. I could not be selfish. Also See: Latest Tottenham transfer rumours Who is the PL\'s greatest wonderkid? Mourinho says it was more important to win the Champions League for people such as Inter chairman Massimo Moratti than for himself \"That is why I felt so special. I felt special because even though it was a very important moment in my carreer too, I managed to keep being humble and calm. I was paying more attention to others\' reactions than mine. It was a beautiful feeling because these guys had this effect and power on me. \"I have heard them many times saying I was very important to them, leaving a lifetime mark in their personal experiences. But I want to see it in another way. They were the ones, important to me.\" Super 6: Dortmund to keep heat on Bayern? Super 6 is back. Do not miss your chance to land the £50,000 jackpot.

Robbie Fowler, Wayne Rooney and Raheem Sterling make our shortlist, but who is the greatest Premier League wonderkid? Last Updated: 22/05/20 1:22pm 5:03 Top 10 Premier League wonderkids Top 10 Premier League wonderkids There have been a number of precocious talents that have graced the Premier League over the past 28 seasons, from Robbie Fowler to Raheem Sterling. Those who have broken into the first team as young teenagers haven\'t always fulfilled their potential but our esteemed list of 10 were always destined for distinguished careers having burst onto the scene. Michael Owen\'s greatest PL goals PL Goals of the Season: 1999/2000 Raheem Sterling is the youngest player to score a Premier League goal at Anfield, doing so at 17 years and 317 days against Reading in October 2012. Robbie Fowler scored more Premier League goals before turning 21 than any other player in the competition\'s history (64). Then there is Gareth Bale, who remains the most expensive British player in Premier League history following his 2013 transfer to Real Madrid from Tottenham. Gareth Bale lit up White Hart Lane during his time as a Tottenham player Nicolas Anelka also makes our shortlist, the only player in Premier League history to net more than 20 goals with four different clubs (Arsenal, Bolton, Chelsea, Manchester City). No list would be complete without Wayne Rooney, who scored 183 Premier League goals for Manchester United - the most by a player for a single club in the competition\'s history. James Milner holds the current record for the most Premier League games scored in without ever losing (54 Games: W43 D11 L0). The original wonderkid Ryan Giggs assisted a Premier League goal for 45 different team-mates during his career, more than any other player in the competition. Rooney followed in the footsteps of Ryan Giggs as a Premier League wonderkid Included in our list is Michael Owen, the youngest player to reach 100 Premier League goals, doing so aged 23 years and 133 days old. Among those still playing is Dele Alli, one of four players to win PFA young player of the year in back-to-back campaigns alongside Giggs, Fowler and Rooney.

And finally, Cesc Fabregas reached 25 Premier League assists at a younger age than any other player, at just 20 years and 134 days. Now, it\'s your turn...
